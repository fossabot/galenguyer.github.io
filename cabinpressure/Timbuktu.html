        <br>
        <br> This week, Timbuktu!
        <br>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Do take your time, Douglas. Still everything to play for. <i>(Gleefully)</i> I’m only twenty-six points ahead of your three points! <i>(He giggles.)</i> But-but I have every confidence you’re about to come <i>roaring</i> back!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes, all right.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: But I <i>am</i> gonna have to press you for an answer, I’m afraid.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(sulkily)</i>: I don’t know. At twenty thousand feet, I suppose about two hundred knots?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Ooh, what a pity! It’s a lovely guess, but I’m afraid the answer on the card was two hundred and four knots! I win again! So that’s Martin on twenty-nine; Douglas ... oh! Still on three ... <i>(he chuckles)</i> ... as we head into round two.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: That was one round?!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, don’t worry, don’t worry. Round two’s <i>much</i> more fun. We say a fond farewell to the flight manual ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Thank God.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... and we welcome instead our very good friend the operations manual!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(protesting)</i>: No! No, I’m sorry, I’m done.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No-no, fair’s fair, Douglas. You promised if I joined in with Flight Deck Buckaroo, I could pick the next game.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: But I <i>hate</i> this game!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, and I hate Flight Deck Buckaroo.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: How can you hate Flight Deck Buckaroo? It’s a <i>terrific</i> game! <i>And</i> it’s educational.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: There is nothing educational about seeing who can disable the most instruments without setting off the recorded warning.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes there is! You find out all the things you don’t really need! Like altimeters.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, <i>this</i> is educational. So, welcome to round two of Beat the Manuals!
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Hello, chaps. Any teas or coffees?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, thank <i>God</i>!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh. Sorry, Douglas, you should have rung.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Actually, we’re fine, Arthur. We-we’ll be landing in twenty minutes.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, right-o. Oh, and a message from Mum. Er, she says how long until we land?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... Right.
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens again.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Drivers, how long ’til we land?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I’m asking them, Mum!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Not quickly enough.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: We’ve just started the descent, Carolyn, so about twenty minutes?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Excellent. Now, Douglas, I am having lunch with Herc. Can you give Arthur a lift home?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Sorry. Happy though I always am to pick up the pieces around your hectic love life, I’m afraid as soon as we land I’m driving to Twickenham. I’ve got tickets for the rugby World Cup final.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Cup final? But ... doesn’t that mean it’s Birling Day?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, Carolyn. Haven’t you told him?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Told me what?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Arthur, there isn’t going to <i>be</i> a Birling Day this year.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(high-pitched in indignation)</i>: What?! Why not?!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Because this year the final is in Twickenham.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, so?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: So, Mr. Birling lives in Sussex. To get to Fitton he would have to drive <i>through</i> Twickenham; and while he certainly has more money than sense, I don’t think anyone has <i>that</i> much more.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(disappointed)</i>: Oh, no. I <i>love</i> Birling Day.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Me too.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Do you?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, no, but I could do with the money.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: True. And <i>I</i> wouldn’t say no to a free bottle of Talisker.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: The bottles of expensive whisky I provide for Mr. Birling’s exclusive use are not ‘free’, Douglas. They are stolen from <i>me</i>.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: And therefore free to <i>me</i>.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(into radio)</i>: Fitton Tower, this is Golf Echo Romeo Tango India established on the ILS.
        <br><b>FITTON ATC</b> <i>(over radio)</i>: ’Ello, ’ello, is it a bird, is it a plane? No! It’s ... oh, no wait, it <i>is</i> technically a plane.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Hello, Karl.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Fitton Tower, please confine air traffic communications to standard phraseology.
        <br><b>KARL</b>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wind two eighty at eight; Runway three-six clear to land; all the usual jazz.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Roger. Clear to land, three-six.
        <br><b>KARL</b>: So-o-o, did you have a lovely time in Luton?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: How could one not? It’s a palace of pleasure.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I mean, seriously, you’re really not meant to just chat on this thing!
        <br><b>KARL</b>: Sorry, Martin. Oh! One last thing, though: did any of you order a furious posh man?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What?
        <br><b>KARL</b>: Only one’s arrived for you – very cross, very drunk. Phil poured him into your Departure Hut.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Lounge.
        <br><b>KARL</b>: Sorry: Lounge. Anyway, hope you like him! Ta-ra!
        <br><i>(Radio off.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: That-that sounds like Mr. Birling!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It <i>does</i> rather, doesn’t it? By the way, cabin crew, prepare for landing.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, right, I’ll go and ...
        <br><i>(Sound of GERTI’s tyres squealing as she touches down and brakes.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Too late.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><i>(Portacabin door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Mr. Birling!
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b> <i>(very drunk and slurring)</i>: Ah-ha! There you are at last.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What are <i>you</i> doing here?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: What am <i>I</i> doing here? The question is: what were <i>you</i> doing <i>not</i> being here ... <i>(he mumbles incoherently)</i> ... before now, eh?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: But we’re not expecting you. You-you-you don’t have a booking.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Booking?! Don’t need a booking! Where else are you lot gonna be – on another job?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, yes.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Don’t be silly. Now then – now you’re <i>finally</i> here, listen. Err, Timbuktu.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What about it?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Is-is it a real place?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes!
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Ah! <i>Told</i> you so, stupid woman!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I beg your pardon?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: I didn’t mean <i>you’re</i> a stupid woman, you silly woman. I mean my awful wife. Have you met my awful wife?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I have met your <i>wife</i>, certainly.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Well, that’ll be the awful one. I’ve only got one. I may be a fool, but I’m not a <i>damned</i> fool.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No, I’m sure you’re not.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: And anyway, I’m <i>not</i> a fool. I knew where Timbuktu was, didn’t I?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: <i>Did</i> you?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Well, I knew it was <i>somewhere</i>. That’s the point – I knew it wasn’t made-up like <i>some</i> people thought it was, naming no wives. Well, where is it, anyway? China or somewhere stupid?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: It’s in Mali, in the middle of Africa, on the edge of the Sahara.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: God, is it? How ghastly. Well, can’t be helped. I want you to fly me there.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: To Timbuktu? Why?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Firstly, none of your business; secondly, to watch the rugby.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: But the rugby is in Twickenham.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: I <i>know</i> the rugby’s in Twickenham. I told my awful wife it was in Twickenham and she said I had to stay and see her awful friends when they came round for her awful thing. And I said I wouldn’t, and she said I must, and I said I wouldn’t, and she said I must, and I said I wouldn’t ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, I believe I’ve picked up the ebb and flow of the debate.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: And in the end she said I could watch it in Timbuktu for all she cares. So I’m going to.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You’re going to fly to Timbuktu to spite your wife?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: That’s the idea, yeah, yeah. Fly to Timbuktu, take a picture to show awful wife who’s boss, i.e. me, <i>I</i> am, find bar in airport, cheer on Wales to glorious victory over the Eyeties, get drunk, fly home.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, I can ask the crew if they would be willing to consider giving up their day off to, er ...
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Oh, can’t we skip all that? I’ll give ’em a couple of grand each and pay you double whatever you were gonna charge.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(instantly)</i>: We should be ready to leave within the hour, sir.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: All right, how are we doing? Where are the others?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Fine. Martin’s panically filing a flight plan, and I’ve sent Arthur into Fitton to buy a book about Timbuktu.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What on earth for?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: He’s in a <i>helpful</i> mood.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, but why do you need a book?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I don’t. I need a temporary absence of Arthur in a <i>helpful</i> mood. And <i>I</i> have just given away a ticket to watch the Cup Final in Twickenham in order that I can fly two and a half thousand miles to the heart of Africa and watch it there.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(fake sympathetically)</i>: Oh, dear. Did the poor little pilot have to fly an aeroplane? <i>(More sternly)</i> You’re getting paid, aren’t you, plus an enormous tip?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I know, I know. <i>And</i> a bottle of Talisker.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No. <i>Not</i> a bottle of Talisker.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: We’ll see, shall we?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No. I mean there won’t <i>be</i> any Talisker to steal. I have to order in the twenty-five year old stuff specially, and there’s no time.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh. Well, in <i>that</i> case, perhaps I can help. I happen to have a few spare bottles knocking about ... for some reason.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(hesitantly, reluctantly)</i>: Oh. Well. That would be very useful. Thank you.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Shall we say two hundred pounds a bottle?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What?! No! I’m not paying you for the whisky you stole from me in the first place!
        <br><i>(Portacabin door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Guys, there’s a problem.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Then solve it.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I can’t solve it.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Have you <i>tried</i> to solve it?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Then you don’t know if you can solve it, do you?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: There’s a civil war in Mali. So Timbuktu’s closed to all air traffic.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... Right. So you <i>can’t</i> solve it.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Thank you.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Douglas, can <i>you</i> solve it?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I appreciate your faith, Carolyn, but I ... I’m not sure even <i>I</i> can broker a peace deal in a civil war. Not in time for kick-off, anyway.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Fine. I <i>knew</i> it was too good to be true. Who’s going to tell Birling?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Wait! Hang on – we can’t just give up!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, <i>you’re</i> the one who said it was insolvable.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: By me, not by you two. There must be <i>something</i> we can do. <i>(He sighs.)</i> Oh, I could really use that two thousand quid.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I know, I know, but what can we do?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, I don’t ... I don’t suppose ... I don’t suppose there’s anywhere that’s a bit <i>like</i> Timbuktu?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What, d’you mean also famous for being far away?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No-no-no, I didn’t mean that. I mean, like, it ... as in ... <i>looks</i> like it, a bit, if you didn’t really know much about Timbuktu.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(surprised)</i>: Martin?!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(impressed)</i>: <i>Martin!</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, I know, I know, I didn’t mean it. I’m just ... I’m just trying to, you know, come up with ideas.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No, Martin! That’s <i>inspired</i>!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Is it?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You’re a <i>genius!</i> An unexpectedly <i>evil</i> genius!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You mean you know somewhere that we could ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, <i>plenty</i> of places! There’s a little airfield on the island of Sardinia, for instance – Guspini. It’s <i>perfect</i>! It’s on the edge of the second biggest desert in Europe, and the chap who runs it is an old friend of mine.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Of <i>course</i> he is(!)
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Couple of hundred Euros and I’m sure he’ll be only too pleased to be Timbuktuan for an hour or two. <i>Three</i> hundred and the engineers can probably knock up a “Welcome to Timbuktu” sign.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, but that’s <i>fraud</i>!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(smugly)</i>: <i>Isn’t</i> it, though? That’s why I’m so delighted <i>you</i> suggested it.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I didn’t mean ... I-I wasn’t seriously ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, don’t <i>spoil</i> it!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Douglas, look: it’s a nice idea, but we cannot possibly ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Look, Birling’s always roaring drunk by the time we land anyway, and all he wants is a room to watch the rugby in and a sign saying, “Welcome to Timbuktu”, both of which Sardinia can provide – and neither of which, incidentally, Timbuktu can provide.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: But won’t he be a bit suspicious that everyone speaks Italian?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Why would he be? Mali was under Italian rule for decades.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh. Was it?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Of <i>course</i> not. But if <i>you</i> didn’t know that, why would <i>he</i>? It’s a <i>great</i> idea, honestly! I don’t know whether I’m more proud of you for thinking of it, or worried that <i>I</i> didn’t.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I-I suppose if we got him really drunk ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>That’s</i> the spirit! And, of course, that’s where the twenty-five year old Talisker will come in so handy.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, no, <i>please</i>, you two – no Talisker stuff! Not if we’re actually gonna do this.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Would you care to take <i>one</i> bottle, madam, or two?
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Hi, chaps. Isn’t this exciting? I’ve <i>always</i> wanted to go to Timbuktu. It sounds brilliant – like a cross between a ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No, wait. Let me guess. A cockatoo, obviously ...
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yes, yeah.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... and, um, errr ... no, I give up.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... and my friend Tim Buckley!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Of <i>course</i>! Silly of me!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, and I, er, I found that book you wanted, Douglas.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What book?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: About Timbuktu.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, right. Yes, well, you hang on to that for now.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, okay. It’s about <i>all</i> of Africa really, but there’s a chapter on Mali and a page on Timbuktu. I’ve nearly finished it.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: The book?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: The page. It sounds <i>amazing</i>. I can’t wait to see it!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, but, Arthur, has no-one told you? We’re not actually <i>going</i> to ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(interrupting)</i>: ... to see much of Timbuktu. I mean, it’s straight out, watch the rugby in the airport, and back again.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, yeah, but I bet at least I see some camels.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: How <i>much</i> do you bet?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(quietly)</i>: Douglas.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Never mind. Er, hadn’t you better go away and hoover something?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Not really. We’re all ready to go.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Fine. Then go away and hoover nothing.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Right-o!
        <br><i>(He leaves.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: So we’re not telling him about ...?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What with him being the worst liar we know, I thought perhaps not.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Mmm.
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: All right, he’s in. Do the briefing, Martin.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(rustling paperwork)</i>: Right. Destination is Guspini, code named Timbuktu. For the avoidance of doubt, crew should note that any time Timbuktu is referred to, Guspini is meant.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes. I believe we’re up to speed with the deception.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: In the unlikely circumstance the <i>actual</i> Timbuktu is referred to, the name is to be repeated twice.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: How d’you mean?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Timbuktu-Timbuktu.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... means Guspini.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No! “Timbuktu” means Guspini; “Timbuktu-Timbuktu” means Timbuktu.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, I see. But you only repeated it once.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I didn’t. I said “Timbuktu-Timbuktu.”
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Exactly. You said it, and then you repeated it. If you’d repeated it <i>twice</i>, you’d have said, “Timbuktu-Timbuktu-Timbuktu.”
        <br><i>(Martin groans.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, excuse me, but I’m trying to run an airline here, not an owl sanctuary. Get on with it!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: All right. The alternate is Palermo, code named Ouagadougou.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: And if the real Ouagadougou is meant?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I really can’t imagine circumstances under which we’ll need to refer to the real Ouagadougou.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: All right, but a good pilot is prepared for <i>any</i> eventuality, however ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ALL RIGHT! The code for the real Ouagadougou is Ouagadougou-Ouagadougou.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Thank God we’re not going to Baden-Baden.
        <br>

        <br><i>(In flight.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Er, Mr. B?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Go away.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah, will do. Er, but first, can myself draw yourself’s kindly attention to the sign that the captain has kindly en-illuminated in regard to the fastenation of your seatbelt during the current highly-unlikely event of turbulence?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: What?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Could you do your seatbelt up?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Certainly not! Do I look like a girl?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: You don’t at <i>all</i> look like a girl.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Well then.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Okay, well, it doesn’t really matter ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(calling from some distance away)</i>: Arthur!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Right, yes, sorry, it <i>does</i> really matter these days.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Since when?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Since Mum said so.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(coming closer)</i>: Is there some problem, Mr. Birling?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: I don’t want my seatbelt on.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh dear. Still, into every life a little rain must fall.
        <br><i>(Click.)</i>
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Did you just ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And now, to console you for your tragedy, can I get you a drink?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Oh, well, um, perhaps a small whisky?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: By all means. Macallans, Johnnie Walker, or Glenlivet?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: What about my special whisky – the Talisker 25?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ah, yes. I’m afraid this trip was at such short notice, we didn’t have the chance to buy that in.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ooh, Mum ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Er, thank you, Arthur. Not now.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b> <i>(angrily)</i>: What?! You realise the only reason I fly on your toy aeroplane is that you carry the whisky I like!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah, really, Mum, it’s important.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Thank you, Arthur. Code Red.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: You’re not the only people who could take me to Timbuktu, you know.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You’d be surprised.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Mum, I really think on <i>this</i> occasion, I-I should over-ride the Code Red! Because you’re forgetting that Douglas ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(loudly)</i>: Code Red, Arthur. Go away, go away fast, and go away now.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Right, yes, will do, yeah.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I will talk to you in the galley.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(nervously)</i>: No-no, you don’t have to. It’s fine – I get it now.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(firmly)</i>: No, I will talk to you in the galley.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(plaintively)</i>: ... Okay.

        <br>

        <br>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Right. First of all, you never over-rule a Code Red.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No, I know, Mum. I’m sorry.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(sternly)</i>: Yes. <i>Why</i> do you never over-rule a Code Red?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(sighing)</i>: Because the Code Red is there to stop me when I’m being too helpful, and I can’t stop being too helpful by being more helpful.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Exactly. Good!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yes, but this time I wasn’t <i>being</i> too helpful! It’s just, Mr. Birling wanted the Talisker, and we want him to be happy, and you’d forgotten Douglas brought some Talisker in case you needed it!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I hadn’t forgotten, Arthur. That is <i>not</i> why I asked him to bring it.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Why, then?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Because today, Arthur, is the Birling Day I steal the Talisker from Douglas Richardson!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ohhh!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ahhh! You get it now?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah! I completely get it! ... Because normally it’s the other way around.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ooh, I <i>do</i> get it!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: So, do you know where Douglas has stashed it?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ooh, no – where?!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: <i>I</i> don’t know! I’m asking <i>you</i>!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Why are you asking <i>me</i>? <i>I</i> don’t know.

        <br><i>(Martin sighs.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... On anything in particular?

        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Martin, relax. I’ve done things like this <i>hundreds</i> of times.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, and you got sacked from Air England.

        <br><i>(Bing-bong)</i>

        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Although of course still a fair way from Timbuktu-Timbuktu.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, for heaven’s sake.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: And how is Mr. Birling?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(anxiously)</i>: Is he awake? Is he drunk? <i>(In a stage whisper)</i> Does he suspect?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, calm down, Martin! Course he doesn’t suspect. Until a few hours ago, he thought Timbuktu was either Chinese or fictional! However, he is fast sobering up.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(panic-stricken)</i>: What? Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no! He needs to be drunk! That’s the key to the whole <i>crime</i>!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, you know what might help with that.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, I do. So – and can we <i>please</i> do this with the bare minimum of gloating – I <i>will</i> buy the Talisker.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: An <i>excellent</i> choice. Madam could not have made a wiser decision.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I said the <i>bare</i> minimum.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: That’ll be three hundred pounds.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Three hun... You said <i>two</i> hundred before.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah, that was the price in Fitton. Alas, the supply is scarcer up here.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Fine. Three hundred.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Excellent.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, get the bottle out, then.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Madam seems a little unfamiliar with how the whole buying process works.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, I’ll pay you when we get back.
        <br><i>(Douglas laughs sarcastically.)</i>

        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes you <i>do</i>.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, show me the bottle and I’ll give you the money.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Better yet, give me the money and I’ll get out the bottle.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I’ve changed my mind. I don’t want it.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Just as you please. But I warn you: the prices are only going to rise.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(increasingly frantically)</i>: Seriously, <i>please</i>, will both of you forget the whisky and concentrate on getting away with the <i>CRIME</i>?!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Martin, for someone who can’t bear to hear the word “Sardinia”, you are making very free with the word “crime.”

        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Er, th-<i>this</i> does.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, yeah, well I can explain that, Skip. Er, Timbuktu is, in fact, in the middle of Africa, so, er, that’s why it <i>looks</i> like this.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Thank you, Arthur.

        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Really? Why?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah, well, you have to remember Mali was part of the Italian Empire for a long time. The ties run deep.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Oh. Was it?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Er, no, Douglas, you’re thinking of France. Mali was in the <i>French</i> Empire.

        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No, I’m terrible at that. No, you lot play, though. I’ll keep you amused. ... Oh, look! Another pizzeria! They really love their pizza in Mali, don’t they? That’s the fourth one we’ve seen.

        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: You’re very quiet suddenly.
        <br><i>(Arthur whimpers.)</i>
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: I said, what’s going on?
        <br><i>(Arthur whines.)</i>
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: <i>What. Is. Going. On?</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(hysterically, rapidly)</i>: Nothing! <i>Nothing</i>’s going on! We’re in Timbuktu, and everything’s totally normal and you can get pizzas <i>anywhere</i> these days, and camels are really shy actually and it’s nothing like Sardinia, which I’ve never been to, and I’m not going to, and I’m <i>definitely</i> not in now!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Arthur! Stop talking!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(high-pitched, rapidly)</i>: I don’t think I can remember how!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Someone else say something! <i>Anything</i>!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(panic stricken)</i>: Er, er, er, er ... Oh, look over there, Mr. Birling! From up here, you can see the sea!
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b> <i>(grimly)</i>: The <i>sea</i>?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, maybe not quite <i>anything</i>.
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br><i>(Back in GERTI.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(tiredly)</i>: Fuel balanced, Douglas.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(flatly)</i>: Good-o.
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, we’ve come to an arrangement.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: He’s not going to sue us.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(sighing with relief)</i>: Good.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... or pay us.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: So essentially we’ve taken a multi-millionaire on a free day-trip to the Mediterranean.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: That’s about the size of it, yes.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, it’s good to give something back, isn’t it?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I’m <i>really</i> sorry, Carolyn.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No, it’s all right. You only finished what Arthur started.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes. It’s been a topsy-turvy sort of Birling Day, hasn’t it? We flew <i>away</i> from the rugby; Mr. Birling got soberer and soberer; and Arthur ruined everything with his knowledge and erudition.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I <i>did</i>, didn’t I?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I don’t think he meant you to be proud.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No, no. ... I am a <i>bit</i>, though.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, and, er, one other thing, Douglas. <i>I</i> stole the Talisker from <i>you</i>.
        <br><i>(Clink of a bottle.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Carolyn! How did you find it?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I told her, Douglas.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You <i>told</i> her?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I see. And how much did she pay you for that little betrayal?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Two hundred pounds.
        <br><i>(Short pause.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Here’s your hundred.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Thank you very much.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: <i>Really</i> sorry, Carolyn. But what I’ve <i>actually</i> learned after five years at MJN is never to side against Douglas on Birling Day.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: So I’m rather afraid, Carolyn, that while you may have stolen the Talisker, you <i>didn’t</i> steal ... oh, could you pass me the operations manual, Martin?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Certainly, Douglas.
        <br><i>(Sound of the manual being moved, followed by a clink of another bottle.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... the <i>Talisker</i>-Talisker.
