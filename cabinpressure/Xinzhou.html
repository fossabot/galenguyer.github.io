        <br>
        <br>This week, Xinzhou!
        <br>
        <br><i>(Arthur is idly humming </i>In the Bleak Midwinter<i> to himself as he rubs something outdoors. A strong wind is blowing.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I wish I had a carrot.
        <br><i>(Crunch of approaching footsteps.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, hi, guys!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(a little breathlessly)</i>: Twenty-one minutes to go. Come on, come on, come on! Where is Martin?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: His hat blew off.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Blew off? How did it blow off? It’s bigger than <i>he</i> is. <i>(Calling out)</i> Martin!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(some distance away)</i>: Yes! Just-just coming!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Leave your blasted hat! Nineteen minutes!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, I know. I just ... Got it!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, come <i>on</i>, then! Arthur, is the cabin ready?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Er, yeah. Cargo loaded, food loaded, cabin checked; and I’ve <i>nearly</i> finished this snowman.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Why are you building a snowman?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... It’s snowy.
        <br><i>(Trotting footsteps.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Here I am.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: At last.
        <br><i>(Martin pants.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Can’t you get a chin strap for that thing?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Don’t give him ideas.
        <br><i>(Plane door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: All right. Everyone in.
        <br><i>(Footsteps on the metal steps.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Right. Eighteen minutes to dusk. Martin, come on! In-in-in!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, but-but-but I’m just ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: This is not the time or the place to admire the beauty of China in the snow.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: To be fair, it <i>is</i> the <i>place</i>.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Douglas. (a) Shut up; (b) go and talk to the Tower.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: But having carried out (a), how can I ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: <i>Now</i>.
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens and closes.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Right, Martin: do the walk-around.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I was about to <i>do</i> the walk-around and you said, “In-in-in.”
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And now I’m saying, “Out-out-out.” Go!
        <br><i>(Martin sighs. The cabin door opens and Martin walks down the steps.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Right, Arthur: get ready for take-off.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Okay. ... Ready.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Good.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: So, given that I <i>am</i> ready, and Skip’ll be a few minutes doing the walk-round, can I very quickly finish my snowman?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(frustrated)</i>: Oh!
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(into radio)</i>: Xinzhou Tower, this is Golf Echo Romeo Tango India. Request start for Fitton.
        <br><b>XINZHOU ATC</b><i> (over radio)</i>: Roger, Golf Tango India, cleared to start. Be advised the airfield closes at dusk.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Thank you, Tower. We know. The scheme we’ve come up with – and I think you’ll admire its simplicity – is to take off before that.
        <br><b>ATC</b>: Golf Tango India, please repeat?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Roger, clear to start.
        <br><i>(Radio off. Flight deck door opens. Martin lets out a noisy shudder.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Good heavens! It’s Frosty the Snow-pilot!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Okay, I’ve done the walk-around, but then ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, all’s going smoothly in here ... oh, except another bit’s fallen off GERTI.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, God. Which one?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: The APU start-up’s failed.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh no!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Luckily, its final act before it expired was to start up the APU. So firstly, it died doing what it loved; and secondly, we’re still good to go.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Good! Now, come and look at the snow.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I can see it from here, Martin. It’s lovely. Sit down, let’s go.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No – I’m worried about it.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, Martin, no. <i>Please</i>.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: You’ll waste more time arguing about it than looking at it.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(tetchily)</i>: Right. Fine.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><i>(Footsteps in deep snow.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(somewhat high-pitched with the cold)</i>: Yes, it’s absolutely fine. Come on!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, I ... I-I-I just think it looks a bit slushy.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It’s not slushy at all! It’s lovely, dry, fluffy snow. If it was slushy, I couldn’t make a snowball out of it, and yet, look.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yeah, but it ... it-it’s not a proper snowball. It hasn’t got much structural integrity ...
        <br><i>(Thump of the snowball hitting Martin. He cries out.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Seems all right to me.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I did <i>know</i> you were going to do that.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: And yet you didn’t duck.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, but look: if you just scoop it lightly ...
        <br><i>(Inside the plane.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, <i>that’s</i> not fair.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What isn’t?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, look out the window. If there wasn’t time for me to finish my snowman, how come Martin and Douglas get to do that?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, good grief!
        <br><i>(Outside.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: You see? It’s still spattering before impact. That’s why it’s not safe ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(walking down the steps)</i>: Gentlemen, I hate to intrude on your pilot-y winter wonderland, but we have eleven minutes to get this thing in the air.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Carolyn, I think the snow on the wings might be too slushy for take-off.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: And I think it’s absolutely fine.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And so you’re settling it with a snowball fight.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No; slushy snow won’t hold its shape in any great volume, whereas <i>dry</i> snow ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Uh, Martin.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Take a look at that. One of Arthur’s finest snowmen. You can’t make <i>that</i> out of slush.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... Oh. Oh – oh well. It must be fine, then.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yep. So everyone back on. We’re flying tonight!
        <br><i>(Footsteps going back up the steps.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Arthur?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Your snowman saved the day.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Brilliant.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><i>(Radio on.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(into radio)</i>: Tower, this is Golf Tango India at the holding point, runway one-eight, ready for take-off.
        <br><b>ATC</b>: Roger. Stand by for clearance.
        <br><i>(Radio off.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes! We actually did it!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: We surprisingly did – and with four minutes in hand!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(sniffing)</i>: That’s funny ... <i>(He sniffs again.)</i> Can you ... can you smell bacon?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(sniffing)</i>: No.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Really? I c... I can <i>definitely</i> smell bacon.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Martin, is this your ‘street’ way of saying you think there’s a policeman on the plane?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No-no, seriously. You-you-you really can’t smell it?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Really? Oh dear. Does it ... does it <i>mean</i> something when you smell bacon?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah, well, that’s one for the philosophers.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Seriously – because ... because if you think you smell burning toast, that means you <i>might</i> be having a stroke. What are you having if you can smell bacon?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Breakfast?
        <br><i>(Martin sighs in exasperation.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(through the closed flight deck door)</i>: Oi! Drivers! What’s going on up there? Are we going or not?
        <br><i>(Bing-bong.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(over cabin address)</i>: Good evening, Carolyns and Arthurs. This is your Douglas speaking. I’m delighted to tell you that four hours in a Chinese traffic jam have not been in vain and we are awaiting clearance to leave the mysterious Orient and return to the obvious Fitton.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> and <b>ARTHUR</b>: Hooray!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I’m joined in the flight deck by Martin, who will be your <i>Martin</i> today.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Hello!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Your cabin service attendants will be <i>you</i>, and I have no doubt they will be doing everything they possibly can to make the pilots’ flight as peaceful and pleasant as possible.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I won’t! I shall be fast asleep throughout.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... which is actually a <i>very</i> good start. Please sit back, relax ...
        <br><b>ATC</b> <i>(over radio)</i>: Golf Tango India.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(into radio)</i>: Roger, Tower.
        <br><b>ATC</b>: Clearance for take-off denied.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What?! Why?
        <br><b>ATC</b>: You have left item of cargo on your stand. Please return and pick it up.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, no, no, no! We haven’t! I did the walk-around! I’m absolutely certain there was nothing left on the ground.
        <br><b>ATC</b>: I can see it from here – about one metre high, half metre wide, white in colour.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It’s a <i>snowman</i>! It’s just a snowman!
        <br><b>ATC</b>: Please return and pick it up.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: But we can’t possibly do that before dusk!
        <br><b>ATC</b>: Dawn is in eight hours and four minutes. Good night!
        <br><i>(Radio off.)</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I’m <i>really</i> sorry.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No, it’s-it’s all right.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(plaintively)</i>: It was just a snowman.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: And you’ve got to remember, it <i>did</i> save the day ... before it ruined the day.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Right. Well, this has been so much fun, let’s do it all again tomorrow morning. Douglas, go and sort us out a taxi back to the hotel. Martin, shut GERTI down. Arthur, sit still and don’t build any snowmen.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(hesitantly)</i>: ... Shut the plane down? Douglas?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, <i>God</i>.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What now?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: The APU starter motor’s down, and if we shut it down, we can’t start it back up again.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh no! ... What’s the APU?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Auxiliary Power Unit.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh no! ... What’s the Auxiliary Power Unit?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: It powers the plane when the engines aren’t on.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Right.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, that’s all right. We-we won’t need any power before we turn the engines back on.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Really? And what will we do to <i>start</i> the engines? Rub two sticks together?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: So ... we have to leave the APU running ’til dawn.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And we can’t leave the plane with it running.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Nope.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: So we are all sleeping on GERTI tonight.
        <br><i>(Slight pause.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: <i>BRILLIANT!</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Okay. So I’ve put three of the seats back as far as they’ll go, and I’ve got all the blankets out of the emergency kit.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: How cosy. And who’s sleeping in the aisle?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Me! It looked more fun.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Hmm. Well, much as I adore a slumber party, I think I’ll just sit in the flight deck and read, actually. I thought I was operating tonight. I’ve had three coffees.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Y-e-s. Thing is, though, Douglas, I’m afraid you sort of <i>have</i> to sleep.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Why?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, we both have to get at least five hours’ sleep, or we’ll be out of hours to fly tomorrow.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Martin, I’ll be <i>fine</i>. One night in nineteen seventy-nine, I stayed awake for five days.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: One night?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: And <i>what</i> a night.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, well, nonetheless, <i>legally</i> ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes, all right.
        <br><i>(Carolyn sniffs.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Arthur? Are you cooking bacon?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Ah! You see? I <i>told</i> you.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What did you tell who?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I told you I could smell bacon! Douglas said he couldn’t.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, yes, definitely fried bacon. What is it?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I dunno. Can you smell it, Arthur?
        <br><i>(Arthur sniffs.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Not really – but smell isn’t my best sense.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Dare one ask what <i>is</i> your best sense, Arthur?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, <i>touch</i>, definitely. We had this game in Science once where you had to work out what things were by feeling them in a bag, and I got nearly all of them – even grapes.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Have you <i>got</i> any bacon? I really fancy some now.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No, but I-I could go and do the dinners.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ooh, yes. I’m ravenous.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Me too. What are we having?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Two chicken; two lamb.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Ah, great! Quick as you can, then.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Right-o!
        <br><i>(Galley curtain rattles as it is opened and then closed.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Damn.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, nothing. I ... I just realised I-I’m not going to be back in time for <i>Tosca</i>.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh dear. That won’t go down well with Herc the Berk.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Do you mind <i>not</i> calling him that?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I’m sorry. Hercules the Berkules.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Anyway, I wasn’t going with him. He’s in Zurich.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I didn’t know Air Cal flew to Zurich.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: They don’t. He’s, um, he’s house-hunting.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... <i>Is</i> he?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Mmm, mmm. Yes – he might ... might move there.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Might</i> he?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes ... if he wants to.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: And <i>might</i> you go with him?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Of course not! Why ever would I?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, you have been going out for a year and a half.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Sixteen months. And we haven’t been “going out”; we’ve just been ... often in the same place.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: How romantic(!)
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: So why might he move to Zurich?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well ... Now look, this is secret, all right? Swiss Airways are launching internationally and they’ve taken over Air Caledonia, so Herc either has to move to Zurich or take early retirement.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Swiss Airways is going international?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes ... although that wasn’t really the focus of my story.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, sorry. It’s just ... th-th-they’ll be recruiting, then, will they?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ah, I see! Yes! Yes – and <i>you</i> should apply.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh. Should he?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, of <i>course</i> he should. I keeping telling him he should be looking for other jobs.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Do you indeed?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes! I’m fed up with not being able to pay him. He needs to spread his wings.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Even as we fold ours.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Do you <i>not</i> think I should apply, then, Douglas?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, I wouldn’t say that. You <i>could</i>. I mean, why not? You never know. But they’re a prestigious airline.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Right.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I mean, by all means throw your hat into the ring. I just wonder if there might be a less intimidating ring to aim for, first time.
        <br><i>(Galley curtain rattles as it is opened.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Er, Mum?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: A quick question: you know those small chickens you get where everyone has one each?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: What are they called?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: <i>Poussin</i>.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh. Not ‘baby chickens’.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh. Chaps, you know how we were talking about mistakes?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What have you done?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... and how they happen to all of us and it’s just one of those things?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What have you done?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(frantically)</i>: It should have made it clearer! When I was ordering the catering, there was one called ‘baby chicken’ and I thought they’d be those little ones, and I <i>love</i> those because you feel like a giant! But they didn’t mean that! It-it meant these.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: So ... the catering you have laid on, Arthur, for four people trapped in a plane overnight, is two jars of chicken-flavoured baby food?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No! That’s <i>not</i> all. There’s two lamb-flavoured ones as well.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What did you think ‘baby lamb’ was?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, <i>all</i> lambs are baby lambs.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: And-and-and what about breakfast?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I didn’t order breakfast.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Why not?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I thought we’d be full from dinner.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(frustrated)</i>: Oh!
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><i>(Rattling of a spoon in a small glass jar.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ooh, well. I’m stuffed(!)
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Hmm.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Very nearly four teaspoons of vaguely chicken-flavoured purée. Ah, couldn’t eat another thing(!)
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Are-are-are-are you sure you’re not gonna have yours, Douglas?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I’ve rarely been surer about anything.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I quite like mine. I might get it again. It’s nice not having to bother with chewing.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: All right. Well, we have feasted. Now let us slumber. Shall I turn out the light?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> and <b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No! This is ridiculous! I’m not in the <i>least</i> tired.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Nevertheless.
        <br><i>(Click.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Arthur. Say something.

        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Question and Answer Film Double Bills.

        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: It’s more maths-y than the name makes it sound.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: So, it-it-it’s quite sort of hypnotic. Let’s just, let’s just try one.

        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Arthur, that-that would just be ...

        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I <i>knew</i> it was you!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Sorry. I didn’t know you were going to use it.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You know, Arthur’s been gone a very long time.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes, he <i>has</i>, rather.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh lord. He’s probably still searching for the inlet. I’ll go and get him.
        <br><i>(The cabin door opens. Footsteps on the metal steps, then they stop.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Guys? There’s ... there’s someone outside by the tail!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, that’ll be Arthur.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No-no-no! Much taller. I think he’s ... I think he’s inspecting the plane.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Really?
        <br><i>(She gets up and joins Martin on the steps.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: See?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, good lord. Um ... <i>(she clears her throat and calls out)</i> ... hallo? <i>(Sing-song)</i> Hall-o!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(sing-song from a short distance away)</i>: Hall-o!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Arthur? Is that you?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Er, <i>that</i> isn’t, but-but <i>this</i> is! Hello!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, what is <i>that</i>?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Before I tell you, I-I promise you I’ll knock him down again before we leave.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(despairingly)</i>: Another snowman. Oh, good lord, it’s a compulsion.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No, it-it-it’s only to keep me busy, because I thought I’d stay out here and keep the intake clear while you guys get some sleep.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yeah, well, it was a very sweet thought, dear, but you can’t possibly stay out here in the cold all night. Now, come on <i>in</i>.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh! Of <i>course</i>!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Arthur</i> can’t, but I know who <i>can</i>. Arthur! Put your back against this with me. Now, one, two, three, <i>shove</i>.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I don’t think it moves, Douglas.
        <br><i>(Scraping of solid snow against the ground.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ooh, it <i>does</i>, though!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What on earth are you doing?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I’m getting us some sleep. You see, what Arthur has very cleverly accidentally done ...
        <br><i>(The snowman continues to slide across the ground. Arthur and Douglas grunt with the effort.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... is build us ...
        <br><i>(More sliding snowman.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... a six foot snow pedestal.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No, it’s a snow<i>man</i>.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It’s <i>both</i>.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: A pedestal? For what?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: For the MJN patent APU Intake Snow Guard! Martin, give me your hat.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What? <i>No!</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, go on. Swiss Airways’ll give you a much nicer one.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I thought you said that was too intimidating a ring to throw my hat into.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Did I? Well, I was forgetting, of course, just how intimidating your hat <i>is</i>.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Ah.
        <br><i>(Crunch as Douglas puts the hat on top of the snowman.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: There. Covers the hole perfectly. I knew it must be good for <i>something</i>.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, wow! So, hang on: my-my <i>first</i> snowman saved but then ruined the day, but my <i>second</i> snowman – and Martin’s hat, and Douglas’ idea, and Mum’s ... er ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... aeroplane.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... aeroplane saved the night!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Exactly, Arthur.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Fizz!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Buzz!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, what the hell. ♪ ’ave a banana! ♪
