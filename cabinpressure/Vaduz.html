        <br>
        <br>This week, Vaduz!
        <br>
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Carolyn, ten minutes.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, all right, Herc. So, last recap: if the phone rings, answer it and take a message. If an email comes in, reply to it. If ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Hang on. I’m taking notes.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: But, er, don’t worry about faxes, guys, because Mum’s put <i>me</i> in charge of the faxes.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(quietly)</i>: Are you sure, Carolyn? Because some people do still have fax machines.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(quietly)</i>: Yes. Yes, some people do. We <i>don’t</i>, though. <i>(Louder)</i> And, most importantly, I will have my phone on at all times. Call me at once if <i>anything</i> happens at all.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Er, i-if I could just clarify that a little. <i>Do not</i> call her, no matter what happens.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Don’t listen to him. Call me if anything goes wrong, or if we get any bookings.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Those are just <i>two</i> of the circumstances under which you should <i>not</i> call. Other such circumstances include the following: <i>any</i> circumstances.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ignore him.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Ignore her.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What a peaceful holiday you two are going to have.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: It is not a holiday; it is a ... trip.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: It’s a <i>holiday</i> – the first holiday I’ve had for years.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I suppose normally you’d just wait for the next honeymoon to roll round.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: What?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Douglas is wittily referring to my four marriages, Arthur, as opposed to his mere three.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Wow! Is that true? You two have got <i>seven</i> ex-wives?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Between us, yes ... I think. There isn’t any overlap, is there, Douglas?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I’d have to check my paperwork.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Seven! That’s enough for a netball team!
        <br><b>HERC</b>: What a chilling thought.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Of course, if Carolyn contributes her two husbands as well, we’re well on our way to a football team.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Thank you, Douglas. That will do.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: I-I think I’d put my second wife in goal.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Hercules Shipwright, did you just do a ‘My ex-wife’s so fat’ joke?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Certainly <i>not</i>! She happens to be a professional goalkeeper.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Really?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: No. She’s huge.
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br><i>(Telephone rings.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Your turn, I think.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(making an annoyed sound, then picking up the phone)</i>: Hello? MJN Air. Captain Martin Crieff speaking.
        <br><b>THERESA</b> <i>(over phone, in a Central European accent)</i>: Hello. I would like a quote for a booking this Friday.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Certainly. May I take your name?
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Yes. I am Princess Theresa of Liechtenstein.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(laughing sarcastically)</i>: <i>Are</i> you?
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: I <i>am</i>, yes.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What a coincidence.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: In what way?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, it’s just that I’m the Lord High Arch-duke Martin of Crieffstonia.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Ahh!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Now what can I do for you?
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Well ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Is it a dragon?
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: What?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: D’you need rescuing from a dragon? Only I know what you princesses are like.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Er, Martin.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Mmm?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: This is nothing to do with me.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, of <i>course</i> not!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No! <i>Really</i>!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: E-e-e-e-excuse me; can you wait a minute?
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: My pleasure. It will allow me to catch my breath from all the hilarity.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Seriously, Douglas – this isn’t one of your mates?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Who is it?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: The Princess of Liechtenstein!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No. The Princess of Liechtenstein is <i>not</i> one of my mates.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Right! Fine! Then <i>you</i> talk to her!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: With pleasure. <i>(Into phone)</i> Hello. This is First Officer Douglas Richardson. I do apologise. We’ve been getting some hoax calls this week. Now, how can we help you?
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Well, I am Princess Theresa of Liechtenstein and I was hoping to charter you to fly the king and I from Vaduz to Fitton.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: But of <i>course</i>! To fly <i>The King And I</i>? Well, this is <i>The Sound of Music</i> to our ears! Why, not since we flew <i>Madam Butterfly</i> to the <i>South Pacific</i> have we had ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Douglas! It’s nothing to do with me either!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes it <i>is</i>; but I must say, answering it yourself first was a <i>very</i> artistic touch.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: <i>Look</i> at me. It’s <i>not</i> me!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, it’s not <i>me</i>!
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Okay! So this has been a lot of fun, but ha-have we perhaps reached the point where one of you might consider googling the words ‘Theresa’ and ‘Liechtenstein’?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Douglas, look. I’ve just ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(smoothly)</i>: Your Royal Highness. How may we be of service?
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><i>(Sounds of people on a beach in the background)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yeah, of <i>course</i> I am, Martin. Tell Arthur to meet me at the airport.
        <br><i>(She hangs up her phone. Crunch of approaching footsteps on the sand.)</i>
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Ah, Carolyn, there you are. Now, you know you were saying what fun wind surfing looked?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I don’t recall saying anything of the kind.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Well, you were very drunk at the time.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I was not!
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Nonetheless, you did say it, and accordingly I have booked us lessons this afternoon.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, that’s nice(!) Anyway, I am going to Liechtenstein.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: I think you might be over-reacting a little.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Martin just called. He’s just had a booking from the King of Liechtenstein.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Well that’s obviously Douglas doing a funny voice.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You would think so, yes, but apparently not.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Well, the boys can cope.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What, with a king? Of <i>course</i> they can’t!
        <br><b>HERC</b>: I didn’t realise you were in such thrall to royalty.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I don’t give two <i>hoots</i> for royalty!
        <br><b>HERC</b>: I think you give four or <i>five</i> hoots.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I do <i>not</i>.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: And not just <i>any</i> old hoots: low and reverent hoots, like an owl at a Jubilee.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No! I’m sorry, Herc. I <i>really</i> have to go.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: No! You don’t. Not on the second day of our first and only holiday in sixteen months together.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Look, I told you when I agreed to come, I’d have to leave if work came up.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: And <i>I</i> told you I didn’t agree and wasn’t listening.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, honestly, Herc. It’s not a big deal.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Well, in fact, it <i>is</i> a bit, because it’s important to me that we spend time together ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, don’t.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: ... because I love you.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(tightly, awkwardly)</i>: Yes. So you keep saying.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: I <i>do</i>, don’t I?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes. Yes, and I wish you <i>wouldn’t</i>. It makes you sound like a Disney toy.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Actually, Disney didn’t come up with the concept of expressing love. Other people have found it important as well.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, who?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Most of humanity.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, there you are, then. You know what chumps <i>they</i> are.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Who, humanity?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, by and large.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: ... Well, granted. But still.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Okay, chaps. I’ve been, er, practising bows. Do you think, er, this one ... <i>(short silence while he does his bow)</i> ... or this one?
        <br><i>(Another short silence, followed by the sound of something being caught in one hand.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: That’s a slightly fancier one.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Isn’t</i> it just? What happens if you don’t catch your hat?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah, I thought of that. Er, I can extend the bit at the end to include picking it up.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Just a simple inclination of the head from the neck, Arthur – that’s enough.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Are you sure? Doesn’t sound very king-y.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: <i>Quite</i> sure. I’ve been brushing up on protocol.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Of <i>course</i> you have.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Also, never look at the king directly.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Are you sure you’re not confusing him with the sun?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: And don’t hold eye contact. Just-just glance up and look away.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Even if we’re looking at him through smoked glass?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Okay, I’m gonna go and practise.
        <br><i>(Flight deck door closes.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: So ... Martin. What sort of team would <i>your</i> exes make?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What? <i>No</i> team. You <i>know</i> I’ve never been married.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Mmm, but what about ex-girlfriends?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I’m not telling you that.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Okay.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: That’s private.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Absolutely. Forget I asked.
        <br><i>(Pause.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: How-how-how-how many people in a bobsled?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Four.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: There’s five in a basketball team, if that helps.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: It doesn’t.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah. I don’t think there’s <i>anything</i> with <i>three</i>.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No ... <i>(he sighs)</i> ... there wouldn’t be.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Hang on; I’ll look it up.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: There’s really no need.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Pétanque!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: There’s three players in a pétanque team! You know, boules – like old Frenchmen play.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(with a resigned tone)</i>: Go on, then.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, I know you only asked me so I would ask you. What sort of a team would <i>your</i> ex-girlfriends be?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Hmmm. Well, you know the start of the London Marathon ...?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, all right!
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Shut-down checks complete; and fuel remaining is ... one thousand six hundred litres.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: One thousand six hundred. Got it. Right. Let’s go – quick, quick, quick.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: We’re still early.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, but we could be earlier.
        <br><i>(Knock on cabin door.)</i>
        <br><b>OTTO</b> <i>(European accent)</i>: Er, hello?
        <br><i>(The door is opened.)</i>
        <br><b>OTTO</b>: Hi. I am Otto.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Hello.
        <br><b>OTTO</b>: I am your ground handling agent today. Er, we hope ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(hastily)</i>: Yes, good-good-good. We’d like to take off at five.
        <br><b>OTTO</b>: Ja, sure, sure. In the meantime, d’you want cleaning services?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Er, no thank you. We take care of that ourselves.
        <br><b>OTTO</b>: Okay, yeah, sure. So, catering services?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, we do that too. Okay, thanks ...
        <br><b>OTTO</b>: Check-in desks?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, again, we ...
        <br><b>OTTO</b>: ... you do it yourselves, sure, yeah. How about ...?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, I’m sorry. We really have to go. We are actually, as it happens, collecting the King of Liechtenstein, so anything else, just-just assume we do it ourselves.
        <br><b>OTTO</b>: Fuel.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh.
        <br><b>OTTO</b>: You have a little portable refinery up there in the tail, maybe?
        <br><i>(Martin sighs in exasperation.)</i>
        <br><b>OTTO</b>: Or will His Majesty be bringing a couple of barrels of his own brew?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Okay, sorry, yes, we want refuelling. We’ll need three thousand litres.
        <br><b>OTTO</b>: Okey-dokey.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><i>(In a car)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Shall I offer to take his crown, or will he want to keep it on for the flight?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Just a minute, Arthur. Martin ...
        <br><i>(Clinking of metal.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Hmm?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What are you doing?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I know you’re going to laugh.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Are you putting on ...?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: It is correct protocol to wear one’s decorations when greeting a foreign head of state.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Medals</i>?! When did <i>you</i> get <i>medals</i>?!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: During the ten years I was a ... member of the Air Cadets.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I see. What’s this one?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: That’s my Cadet Forces Medal.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: For ...?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Being in the Air Cadets.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Impressive stuff! And the other one?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(hurriedly)</i>: Doesn’t matter.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It <i>does</i> matter.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: You’ll only make fun of it.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Martin, let us be perfectly clear: the good ship Douglas Making Fun of Martin’s Medals set sail the moment you took the decision to put on some medals. The voyage is now well underway, and I can only suggest you relax and enjoy it. What’s the other one?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... It’s ... my Millennium Star.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Is</i> it?! And that’s awarded for ...?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I think you know what it’s for.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I have a wild hope, certainly, but surely it’s too good to be true.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: It was awarded – by the Queen – to all serving members of the Armed Forces <i>and</i> Cadet Corps ... to commemorate the new millennium.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(delightedly)</i>: It <i>is</i>! You’re going to meet the King of Liechtenstein wearing a medal you got for being alive in the year two thousand!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I wish <i>I’d</i> known. <i>I</i> could have got that one.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><i>(In a restaurant)</i>
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Thank you for staying.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, yes, yes. You already said that.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: And I’m saying again: I really appreciate you staying.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes-yes-yes. All right, fine.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Because ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes-yes, thank you. That’s lovely.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: ... I love you.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: <i>Yes</i>, I am <i>aware</i>. The information has been duly noted. Thank you for your feedback.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: And do you ...?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(her voice getting increasingly high-pitched)</i>: No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!
        <br><b>HERC</b>: No?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Not, ‘No, the answer’s “No”,’ ... ‘No, don’t ask.’
        <br><b>HERC</b>: So the answer’s <i>not</i> no.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I said, ‘Don’t ask’; don’t ask, don’t tell, like gay American soldiers before two thousand and eleven.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Well I’m <i>not</i> a gay American soldier before two thousand and eleven; I am, in fact, <i>none</i> of those things. And I am interested in whether or not you feel as strongly about me as I do about <i>you</i>.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: <i>Why</i>? Look, we’re-we’re doing very well as we are. Why-why can’t we carry on like this?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: But what if we wanted to get married?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: But we don’t <i>want</i> to get married, though, do we? Not in the least tiniest little bit.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: <i>I</i> might want to.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, Hercules, but let’s face facts: <i>you</i> wanting to get married is like other people wanting to sneeze. Besides, ‘Knapp-Shappey’ is bad enough as a surname. I’m <i>damned</i> if I’m going to become ‘Knapp-Shappey-Shipwright’.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Yes, I see what you mean. It <i>does</i> sound a bit like a soft shoe shuffle.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><i>(Outdoors.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Wow! It’s an <i>actual</i> castle!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What did you expect Vaduz Castle to be?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I dunno. World of Leather was <i>very</i> disappointing.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What do we do now?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Knock?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Can you just <i>knock</i> at a castle?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I don’t see why not. What was your plan: jangle your medals together?
        <br><i>(Knocking on the door, which is then opened.)</i>
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Hello. Oh, are you the pilots?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Er-er, er, yes. Hello. Er, we’re-we-we’re here to see, er, Princess Theresa.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: I know, yes. Hello.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Hello. So-so is she in?
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Yes she is in ... <i>front</i> of you. Hello. Come in.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh. Right.
        <br><i>(They go inside.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(clearing his throat)</i>: Your Royal Highness, if I might introduce myself. I am <i>Captain</i> Martin Crieff.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Oh, I remember you! You’re here to save me from a dragon, yes?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Terribly sorry about that.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Oh, no, don’t worry. It happens a lot!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... Okay. And, er, and this is First Officer Douglas Richardson, and Mr. Arthur Shappey Esquire, who will be providing customer service.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(quietly to Douglas)</i>: Mr. Arthur Shappey what?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(quietly)</i>: Esquire.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: What’s a squire?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>You</i> are.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Brilliant!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: The head of our company, Mrs Carolyn Knapp-Shappey, presents her compliments and her profound apologies not to be here in person, but rest assured, she will be waiting to greet you on our arrival in Fitton.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Really? Why?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... W-well, you know, to provide an ... official reception and-and to ... sweep the building for ... assassins.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Ooh! Right. Well, d’you get a <i>lot</i> of assassins in your airport?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: We do in the winter months. I think the cold drives them inside.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(through gritted teeth)</i>: Douglas!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Excuse me, your Princess.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Theresa is fine.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Er, Theresa. When do we get to see the king?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Arthur! I-I-I’m so sorry. He-he...
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Oh, no, no, no, it’s fine. I’ll get him. <i>(Calling out)</i> Maxi! Your pilots are here!
        <br><b>MAXIMILIAN</b> <i>(a teenage boy, excitedly)</i>: Yaaaay!
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: And you can come and meet them as soon as you’ve finished your carrots!

        <br><b>MAXIMILIAN</b>: It is in Liechtenstein.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No it’s not!
        <br><b>MAXIMILIAN</b>: It <i>is</i>, because I’m the King of Liechtenstein and I say it is. A hundred points to me!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(frantically)</i>: There <i>aren’t</i> any points!
        <br><b>MAXIMILIAN</b>: There <i>are</i> in Liechtenstein.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Maxi! Stop being horrible! I’m sorry – Maxi is going through a stage where he’s very pleased with himself for being accidentally born king. <i>(She chuckles in embarrassment.)</i> They all go through it! For my father, it lasted sixty years!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: So you’re Maxi’s sister?
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: I’m the oldest; he’s the youngest. Six sisters, then Maxi.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Good lord!
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Yes. My father’s motto was, ‘If at first you don’t succeed ...’
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: And what takes His Majesty to Fitton?
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: He’s going back to school.

        <br><b>MAXIMILIAN</b>: Then you’re stupid. I <i>hate</i> school.

        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Not at <i>this</i> school. He shares a desk with the Sheikh of Qatar.
        <br><b>MAXIMILIAN</b>: Yes, but he’s only a prince. I outrank him.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Maxi, I keep telling you: people don’t make friends by telling other people how much they outrank them.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: That’s true, actually!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes. Captain Crieff – as you can see – is a grizzled veteran of the Air Cadets.

        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Well, now! I think we can do a little better than that. You have provided aid to the Royal Family, so straight away you can have the Star of Liechtenstein ... <i>(clinking as she adds the medal to Martin’s bar)</i> ... the <i>Wreath</i> of Liechtenstein ... <i>(another clink)</i> ... and, er, ooh, I don’t know what the last one is called ... the Little Wobbly Stick of Liechtenstein.

        <br><b>OTTO</b>: Because you <i>asked</i> for three thousand litres.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No I didn’t. I said, ‘We’ll <i>need</i> three thousand litres.’

        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, but ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes, well, whoever’s fault it is ...
        <br><b>OTTO</b>: It’s <i>his</i> fault.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I know. But the good news, Martin, is we’re still under maximum take-off weight.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, good.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: The <i>less</i> good news is that when we get to Fitton, we’ll still be <i>way</i> over maximum landing weight.

        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh yes it is, because the stakes are higher. Why would you go to Switzerland?

        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Why?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Because Swiss Airways are going international next year.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh. Bully for them.

        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ohh.

        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, <i>I</i> don’t know.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Well, nor do I. Fifty-six year old pilots are far less in demand that you’d think.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I’d assume they’re in no demand whatsoever.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: I realised, even as I said it, I was talking to the wrong person.

        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Wwwwow! That was amazing! I thought you said you <i>weren’t</i> that sort of princess?
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: No, but my mother is. That was basically her.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Thank you <i>so much</i>. You saved my life.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Yes, well – always useful to have a princess around to rescue you from dragons.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Honestly, I-I-I don’t know how I can thank you.
