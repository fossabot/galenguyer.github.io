        <br><i>(Radio on.)</i>
        <br><b>FITTON AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL</b>: Welcome home, Golf Tango India. Vacate runway to your right and taxi to your stand.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(flicking switches)</i>: Thank you, Karl. Oh, incidentally, be advised: as we landed we saw a large hawk or kestrel about fifty feet from the runway.
        <br><b>KARL</b>: Noted, Golf Tango India. What was it doing?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Watching how it’s <i>supposed</i> to be done.

        <br>This week, Kuala Lumpur!
        <br>
        <br><i>(Portacabin office door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Mum? Can I borrow your car?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Why? What’s wrong with <i>your</i> car?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: It’s really old and it’s a horrible colour and it smells of duffel coats.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, what’s wrong with it that’s stopping you driving it?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Only <i>those</i> things, but I thought since we were on standby this week, I might go for some drives in a <i>nice</i> car, like yours.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No you won’t – because you and I will be using this week to see if we can ease your stewarding skills up above that crucial dividing line between Very Bad and merely Bad. I’m going to be your Mystery Passenger.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Brilliant! Will there be clues?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I <i>mean</i> we are going to sit in the plane and you’re going to practise serving me.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Right! So what’s the mystery?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: The mystery is who I am.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: And who <i>are</i> you?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I’m me.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: That’s not very mysterious.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(wearily)</i>: Oh, life’s too short. You and I are going to pretend to be a steward and a passenger ...
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ah, right! Bagsie be the steward!
        <br><i>(Knock on the door, which then opens.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Hello, Carolyn? Um, just had a thought.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh good! A pilot with a thought! How the gods smile upon me.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: It just occurred to me, for weeks like this, we really ought to have a pilots’ lounge.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(sternly)</i>: A <i>what</i>?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: A pilots’ lounge.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Martin, the very last thing I want to do is encourage either of you to do any more lounging than you already do.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: It wouldn’t be for lounging in. It would be for our briefings; doing our log books. I thought maybe each month one of us could present a paper on some aspect of aviation that interests us.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And to think, a moment ago, I thought the idea couldn’t sound less appealing.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: But, Mum, you-you could make money out of it. You could sell drinks.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Without a licence – to pilots?!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No-no, I mean tea and coffee and things – to David and George from Engineering, and the fire crew, and Karl the ATC; even Dirk the groundsman.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Er, no, no, no – i-it would be a <i>pilots’</i> lounge, not for those guys – for the <i>pilots</i>.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: But that doesn’t make sense. <i>I’m</i> not a pilot.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: But <i>I’d</i> be allowed in.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Martin, if you can find an empty room on the airfield, you are welcome to sit in it; and if you can lure Douglas in and then keep him there long enough to read a paper at him, you’re a better man than I am, Gunga Din. Close the door on your way out.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: But ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: On which, you should now go. I’m sorry; I thought that was implied.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><i>(Sound of someone rattling a door handle in an attempt to open the door.  Voices are a little echoey.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Any good, Skip?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, Arthur, because it’s locked.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ah. Ooh! I’ll tell you where you <i>could</i> try, though – how about that scrap DC-10 fuselage out round the back of the hangar? I mean, it’s probably full of rats and cobwebs and skeletons, but if we clean it up ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: That’s actually not a bad idea.
        <br><i>(Footsteps as they head outdoors.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Tell you what, though, Arthur: if it <i>does</i> turn out to be suitable, I thought we might strike a happy compromise between my idea of keeping it just for pilots and your idea of inviting everyone who works on the airfield.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: What would that be?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Just the pilots. And you.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ooh! So I’d be like an honorary pilot!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, you’d just be ... you.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Great! Although, the engineers and everyone are <i>really</i> good fun. George does these brilliant impressions of fruit.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, I’m-I’m sure they’re great, but-but what I want is a nice civilised arena to compare notes with my fellow professionals.
        <br><i>(Footsteps stop.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Right, here it is.
        <br><i>(Distant sound of laughter.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Is there ... is there someone <i>in</i> there?!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Sounds like it.
        <br><i>(Fuselage door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: All right, next one, next one, next one, right? Number twelve: the conference pear!
        <br><i>(Raucous cheering from several people.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Wow! Dave! George! Everyone! Hi!
        <br><b>GEORGE</b> <i>(nervously, as everyone else falls silent)</i>: Arthur! Captain Crieff!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Can someone please tell me what the <i>hell</i>’s going on in here?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Hallo, Martin.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Douglas!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Welcome to the Flap and Throttle.
        <br><i>(Cheers from everyone else.)</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><i>(Outside the fuselage.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: What a brilliant place, Douglas!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: How long’s it been going on?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: We just had our third anniversary, actually.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: So before I even got here?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Why didn’t you tell me about it?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, we were just waiting for you to settle in – you know, get comfortable with everyone.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I’ve been here a year and a half!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: And we’re still waiting.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I see. So it’s an illegal pub for everyone who works on the airfield except me.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, to be honest, I didn’t think you’d approve.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I <i>don’t</i> approve!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I thought you might have told Carolyn or the airfield manager.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I <i>might</i> have done!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Right. So that’s why we didn’t tell you.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah, but why didn’t you tell <i>me</i>?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Because it was a secret, Arthur, and you are – without a shadow of a doubt – the worst liar in the world.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(indignantly)</i>: I’m not!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: All right: answer this question with a lie. What’s your name?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Arth... nold ... man, er ... cat, sir, man.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Arthnold Manercatsirman.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(dubiously)</i>: Yeah.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: That’s an unusual name. Tell me: is it made-up?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yes, it is. <i>Oh!</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You see, that’s the sort of trick question you wanna watch for. I’ll tell you a secret: the way to lie convincingly is never make something up. Just tell a different truth. So, if you have to lie about where you were today, tell them where you <i>really</i> were <i>last</i> week.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ah.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: If you have to give a false name, use a <i>real</i> name you already know. Try again: what’s your name?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(after a moment’s thought)</i>: Douglas Richardson!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Better. <i>Not</i> quite perfect.
        <br><i>(Sound of a siren.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh. I forgot. Mum’s waiting for me in the plane.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What for?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: She’s being my Mystery Passenger.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, good luck. Let us know if you work out who she is.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Right-o!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(as Arthur walks away)</i>: Douglas – an illegal pub on an airfield is <i>incredibly</i> dangerous <i>and</i> irresponsible.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Don’t be so melodramatic. No-one drinks when they’re on duty. It’s just a bit of fun. It’s more about the secret club atmosphere – you know, like at school.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Not at <i>my</i> school.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, come on! You must have had secret clubs in the lunch break at least!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, actually. People weren’t really around during lunch break. I think they went home or ...
        <br><i>(He trails off.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, anyway, I-I-I thought you didn’t drink? I thought you hadn’t had a drink for nine years?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Martin, that is a <i>secret</i>. I have carefully built up my reputation as a hard-boozing sky god, and I’m not having <i>you</i> spoil it.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: So what <i>do</i> you drink there?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: If you <i>must</i> know – you know every year I win a bottle of Talisker single malt from Carolyn?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Steal.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Win</i>. Well, I keep it in the Flap and Throttle. Everyone knows it’s for my personal use only. Not everyone knows it’s refilled with apple juice.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, Douglas, look, I’m sorry. Either you close it down immediately or I’ll be forced to inform Carolyn.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>I</i> can’t close it down. It’s not my pub. If you want it stopped, you’ll have to come down and tell them yourself – all the mechanics, the engineers, the fire crew ... <i>Dirk</i> the groundsman.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I’m not afraid of them!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Nor <i>should</i> you be – not even <i>Dirk</i>.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, I’m <i>not</i>.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Good.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Why not even Dirk?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No reason. I just mean, someone who <i>was</i> afraid of them would probably start by being afraid of Dirk. It’s the natural place <i>to</i> start.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, I’m not! And I’ll come and tell them this evening.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ooh! Full moon!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Stop it!
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Arthur, where have you been? I told you to meet me in the cabin half an hour ago.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Sorry, Mum. I’ve been ... I’ve been to the dentist.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, <i>have</i> you?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yes, I have. He said I’ve been brushing really well but to watch out for my gums.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Right – so no real change since <i>last</i> week, then, when I took you.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh yeah.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Leave the lying to Douglas, dear. He’s the professional. So: it’s a normal flight; I’m the passengers; you’re you. Off we go.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: W-wait-wait. Where are we going?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, it doesn’t matter. Er, Pisa.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(disappointed)</i>: Oh! We went to Pisa <i>last</i> week.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, where do you <i>want</i> us to go, then?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Kuala Lumpur.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Why Kuala Lumpur?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: It’s like Helsinki: I’ve always wanted to go there. It sounds like ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(interrupting)</i>: Arthur. Let me warn you: I am not in the best of tempers and I strongly advise you <i>not</i> to start talking about a city populated by either koalas or Oompa Loompas.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... I have nothing to say.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Good! And ... go! <i>(In a slightly posher voice)</i> Excuse me, steward. Where can I smoke my cigarette?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh! I’m sorry, madam ... This is brilliant! It’s like acting!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Get on with it!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I’m sorry, madam, er, but for your happy convenience, cigarettes may not be enjoyed anywhere on board at this time.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh. All right. What about this pipe?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... I’m not sure. Um, let me just ask my ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: She’s not on board.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, okay. Er, well I ... I-I’m gonna go for ‘no.’ Sorry.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: A reefer?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I don’t.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: It’s medicinal.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ooh, medicinal! Well, I expect, er ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No! I expect no! That’s what I was gonna say: I expect definitely not!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Arthur. Here are the things you <i>can</i> smoke on board ...
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ooh, no, hang on, wait. I’ll write it down.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You don’t <i>need</i> to write it down! It’s nothing! You can’t smoke <i>anything</i> on the plane.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Nothing.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Nothing.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... I’d still quite like to write it down.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><i>(Drinking glasses clink.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Okay, he’s on his way. Now, remember: we’re aiming for something between the bar in <i>Cheers</i> and the Mess Hall in <i>Dam Busters</i>; and I know you’d <i>think</i> if you use “Captain” in every sentence he’ll think you’re taking the piss, but actually, he won’t. Right, here he is.
        <br><i>(The fuselage door opens.  Everyone cheers.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Welcome, Martin, to the Flap and Throttle.
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: Pleasure to see you here, <i>Captain</i>.
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: An honour, Captain, a <i>real</i> honour.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What’s going on?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I mentioned you were coming down and, well, everyone was very excited.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well ... I hope you told them <i>why</i> I was coming.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Of course not. That’s <i>your</i> job.
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: Now it’s a <i>proper</i> club, isn’t it?
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: Yeah. It’s all very well havin’ the first officer down ’ere, but the <i>captain</i>, Captain – that’s different.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Then ... why didn’t you ask me?
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: Never thought you’d accept, Captain.
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: We thought you’d be one of those standoffish captains, Captain – too grand to mix with the ground staff.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(clearing his throat awkwardly)</i>: Yes, well ... Look, you don’t have to call me “Captain” all the time, you know.
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: Oh, right.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: “Skipper” will do.
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: Thanks, Skipper. Appreciate it.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, all right, listen ... er, men. Er, the fact is ...
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: No, hang on, hang on, hang on. Can’t have the skipper giving a speech without a glass in his hand. What you havin’, Skipper?
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: No, no. I’m the chief engineer. I get to buy Skip a drink.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Ah, well, this – this is just it. Er, I-I-I-I’m afraid I simply can’t ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(interrupting)</i>: Martin, a quick word.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Now?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Operational matter.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: All right.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(quietly)</i>: Martin, it’s up to you, of course, but I just thought I should let you know: these people are very proud. In their culture, there’s nothing more insulting than to spurn a gift. It’s a terrible loss of face.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What, engineers?! A-are you sure you’re not thinking of the Japanese?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, there’s so many great Japanese engineers, the culture’s rubbed off on them.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Douglas, I can’t allow an illegal bar to operate on an airfield property, still less partake myself. What would Carolyn say if she found out?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I don’t know. Then again, these guys are all self-employed. If you close down their pub, they’ll probably refuse to work for us, and then MJN would fold instantly. I don’t know what she’d say about <i>that</i>, either. But it’s your choice.
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: ’ere we are, Skipper. Your first pint at the Flap and Throttle.
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: First of many.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, really, stop it. You-you must understand, I really cannot accept this drink.
        <br><i>(Silence falls.)</i>
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: You can’t accept it?
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: Well, why not, Skipper?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... Because ... as the skipper ... first round is <i>my</i> round!
        <br><i>(Cheering.)</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: All right. Today, we’re going to build on yesterda... We’re not going to let yesterday get us down. Now, let’s see you taking meal orders. Go.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Hello, madam. Chicken or beef?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Beef, please.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Okay. ... How did I do?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Keep going!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh. Er, right-o. Hallo, madam. Chicken or beef?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Chicken, please.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: You said, “Beef,” just now.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I was being someone different!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: That’s pretty confusing, Mum. Couldn’t you at least do a different voice?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No I couldn’t!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Please? Because in real life they’d have different voices. And faces.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, all right. <i>(In a bad Scottish accent)</i> Chicken, please.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Certainly, madam! And for you, madam?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(deep voice)</i>: Sir.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I beg your pardon, sir. Er, chicken or beef?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(deep voice)</i>: How is the chicken cooked?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Four minutes on ‘defrost’; shake the bag; three minutes on ‘full.’
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(normal voice)</i>: <i>No</i>! Don’t tell them that!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Sorry, are you being you again, or him, or one of the others?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: <i>Me</i>! Just don’t tell him we reheat it.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, he must <i>know</i>! I mean, obviously we don’t have a whole kitchen back there! He’s not stupid.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes he is. Everyone on this plane is stupid until proved otherwise.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Shall I put that on the list?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Isn’t it there already?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(unfolding a piece of paper)</i>: Er, “The customer is always: Wrong ; Rude ; Late ; Witless ; Loud ; Drunk ; Thieving; and Sly.” I suppose “Witless” sort of covers stupid.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, I don’t know. Stick “Stupid” down as well. Have you got “Rude”?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(consulting his paper again)</i>: Er, yep.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Put it down again. It’s a good one.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><i>(Background conversation.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You <i>say</i> that, Dave, but they equalised within ten minutes, so I-I don’t ...
        <br><i>(Fuselage door opens and closes.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Evening, chaps!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, hello, Martin.
        <br><b>DAVE</b> and <b>DAVE</b> <i>(disinterestedly)</i>: All right?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Sorry. I-I didn’t mean to interrupt. Er, carry on.
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: Oh, we were just talkin’ about, er ... Did you see the match, Skipper?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: The ... match? No, I missed the match. I-I think we were on a trip.
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: It only finished twenty minutes ago.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, <i>that</i> match! Oh, I was thinking of another match. No, I didn’t see that one either. I missed ... missed both the matches.
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: Right. Well, I was just sayin’, City never had a hope once they were down to ten.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, well, a-as I say, I missed it.
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: Yeah, but you see what I’m sayin’?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh yeah ... yeah! Yeah, of course, yes, I see what you’re saying. Ten’s ... ten’s not enough. You need a lot more than-than ten!
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: Well, you need eleven.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: That’s what I mean – eleven, yes! That’s what you need. Not ten.
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: Who do <i>you</i> support, Skipper?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: In football?
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: Yeah.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: England. W... no, I mean <i>obviously</i>, er, England ... and ... er ... United.
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: <i>Which</i> United?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(very hesitantly)</i>: Nottingham.
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: Nottingham United? Never ’eard of ’em. What league are they in?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I don’t follow that closely, actually.
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: Yeah, but you <i>must</i> know what league they’re in.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: In many ways, they’re in a league of their own. Aren’t they, Martin?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, that’s right.
        <br><i>(He laughs nervously.)</i>
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: Right. <i>(He chuckles.)</i> You from up Nottingham way originally, then?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No – Wokingham. Down Wokingham way!
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: Why’d you pick Nottingham to follow, then?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well ... Nottingham, Wokingham – they sound <i>very</i> similar.
        <br><i>(Awkward silence for a moment.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Tell you what, though, George: er, you’ll be interested in this. You know that little Cherokee that was out doing circuits today? Well, on his third landing, he ...
        <br><i>(Cries of “Ohh!” from everyone, as someone repeatedly rings a bell behind the bar.)</i>
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>, <b>DAVE</b> and <b>OTHERS</b>: Oh, shop! <i>(This gradually turns into a chant of “Shop, shop, shop, shop!”)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(anxiously)</i>: What’s going on?! What have I done?!
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: Talkin’ shop, Skip. Sorry – automatic round forfeit.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What?!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Flap and Throttle house rules, I’m afraid, Martin. Anyone caught talking shop has to buy a round for the whole bar.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Then, how d’you talk about flying?
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: Well, you <i>can’t</i>, can you? That’s the point.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: So what d’you <i>talk</i> about?
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: I dunno! Music, sport, women!
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: The meanin’ o’ life. <i>Anything</i> but bloody planes, eh?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes. Yeah, of course. <i>(Sadly, his voice getting quieter)</i> Yeah, who wants to talk about stupid ... aviation?
        <br><i>(The bell begins to ring again and everyone takes up a new chant.)</i>
        <br><b>EVERYONE</b>: A-bomb! A-bomb!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, come on! Go easy on him, chaps! He’s new!
        <br><b>DAVE</b>: <i>A</i>-bomb!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, all right, fine. Sorry, Martin. The “A” word is banned.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(nervously)</i>: Oh, I-I-I see. <i>(He chuckles.)</i> A-another round for everyone?
        <br><b>GEORGE</b>: Ooh!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No – I’m afraid having two consecutive forfeits incurs a Whoops Johnny.
        <br><i>(The patrons laugh gleefully.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: A what?!
        <br><b>EVERYONE</b> <i>(in a chant)</i>: <i>Whoops</i>-Johnny-Johnny-Johnny, <i>Whoops</i>-Johnny, <i>Whoops</i>-Johnny-Johnny-Johnny-Johnny!
        <br><i>(They all cheer.)</i>

        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(in a sort of Southern American voice)</i>: Madam.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Madam. Er, would you like chicken or beef?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(same American voice)</i>: Well, now, that all depends. You see, I’m a celiac.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ooh! Lovely! Chicken or beef?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(American)</i>: It means I’m gluten-intolerant.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, I’ll-I’ll try not to be too ... gluten annoying.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(American)</i>: It means I can’t eat gluten.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... <i>We’ve</i> got chicken or beef.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(American)</i>: Gluten is in wheat products.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, right! Yeah, with you. Erm, I think they’re both fine.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(American)</i>: No wheat in either?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Don’t think so.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(American)</i>: Right. Then I will have the chicken.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Okey-dokey.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(in her normal voice)</i>: Which is coated in breadcrumbs, so I’ll have a violent reaction, my airways will swell up and maybe I’ll die.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Perhaps the beef.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Arthur, what things are made of wheat?

        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(frantically)</i>: I hate it! Douglas, I really, really, really hate it. I hate the drinking games and the pop quizzes and the round forfeits and the competitive farting, and the Whoops Johnnys and the <i>bloody</i> anchovies ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: If it’s any consolation, I thought you coped very <i>well</i> with being anchovied. You had a real quiet dignity.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I just can’t stand it!

        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Arthur, you haven’t managed <i>any</i> of these things on their own. What makes you think you can handle them together?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I can’t eat eggs and flour and sugar on their own, but I can eat cake.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... All right – but only if you <i>really</i> manage it.

        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Mum, excuse me, I am trying to talk to Mr. Powell. Mr. Powell, could you look after the little girl, please?

        <br><i>(Slight pause.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(calmer)</i>: How did I do?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, it’s not how they teach it in the training courses but I have to admit, it is what <i>I</i> might have done. Here: <i>(jingle of car keys)</i> catch.

        <br><b>DAVE</b>: Yes, you did! You said you’d pop in at seven forty-five; and now it’s gone eight!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I said ‘about’ seven forty-five.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, it doesn’t matter – he’s here now. Come and join us, Arthur. I was, er, just telling Dave about the landing into Nice.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ooh, what about the talking shop forfeit?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, I’ve paid for that.

        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yep.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: That doesn’t sound much like you.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No. I’m quite enigmatic, though.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: And <i>I’d</i> have thought you’d have had enough of Italian food since we were in Pisa last week.

        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Of <i>course</i>(!) And the walk afterwards: where did you, Douglas and ... Mark Ramprakash go?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(his voice becoming increasingly plaintive)</i>: We went to see the ... Tower ... of ... Air Traffic Control.

        <br><i>(Martin hangs up.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: She’s coming straight over.

        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Really, Martin? Everything? Including the four days you spent as a pillar of the Flap and Throttle?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, but I didn’t <i>want</i> to. A-a-and anyway, this isn’t about that pub; it’s about <i>this</i> pub – the one you left me out of.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You <i>wanted</i> to be left out of it! You <i>told</i> me so! You <i>wanted</i> to go back to not knowing! I was <i>trying</i> to help.

        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Also names. Faces and names – those are my weak spots.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Douglas, I’m serious. We need to have a talk.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Always a pleasure; never a chore.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... in which I may have to fire you.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Quite right too.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I’m not joking.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Absolutely not! It’s terribly serious – and that’s certainly how you <i>should</i> react <i>if</i> I ever set up an illegal bar in the airfield.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You <i>have</i>!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, no, I haven’t. You see, Carolyn, I am your Mystery Perpetrator of Gross Professional Misconduct. Hallo.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Arthur was telling me about all the fun you’ve been having with the Mystery Passenger lessons, and I thought it was a shame for you and Martin to miss out, so I arranged this – and you both did terribly well!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Douglas, I am not an idiot. This place is full of booze.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: But <i>is</i> it, though? Martin, pass me one of those bottles, would you? Absolutely any one at all. Your free choice.
        <br><i>(Clinking of a bottle.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Here you are.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah, the Talisker! Excellent choice, sir.
        <br><i>(Sound of liquid pouring into a glass.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: There we are. On the house. Tell me what you think.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(taking a drink)</i>: Apple juice.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It <i>does</i> have apple-y overtones, doesn’t it? Or, if you prefer, I can do you water, cold tea, or I think <i>this</i> one’s mouthwash.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You went to all this trouble just to wind me up?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You <i>and</i> Martin. It was an irresistible two-for-the-price-of-one deal.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You are an infantile time-wasting sorry excuse for a pilot, and I ought to fire you anyway just to teach you a lesson.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes. Funny, though, wasn’t it?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Martin.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Are you still there?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Then don’t be.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Right.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(as the door closes and the sound of Martin’s footsteps recedes outside)</i>: Right. Now, Douglas, listen to me.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes, Carolyn?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: A double gin and tonic, please, with ice and lemon.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Coming right up.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(as Douglas prepares her drink)</i>: D’you think that went all right?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Very well, I thought. I’m impressed he took four days to tell you. I thought it would be sooner.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I’m rather insulted he believed I’d fall for that rotten apple juice trick.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: All in a good cause. Now Martin can return to blissful ignorance; the boys can relax again; and you can start coming back to the pub.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Where’s the new one going to be?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: We thought the fire crew break room. The Hose and Hydrant?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Perfect. Cheers.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Cheers.
