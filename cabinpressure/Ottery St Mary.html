    <article>
        This week, Ottery St Mary!
        <br>
        <br><i>(Flight Deck door opens)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Here we are, chaps ... er, chap. Coffee for you, Douglas, and coffee for you ... to maybe have a bit later on, Douglas.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Did you by any chance forget Martin wasn’t flying today, Arthur?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No, I didn’t, actually. It’s just, I only know the amounts to make coffee for two people.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You <i>could</i> just have made half what you usually make.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, I <i>couldn’t</i> because I’d only know what to make half of once I’d made it, and once I’d made it, I’d made it.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh well, fair enough, then. I didn’t realise you’d addressed the problem scientifically.
        <br><i>(The sat comm bleeps)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Hello? Starbucks, Irish Sea.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(over sat comm)</i>: Douglas, it’s Martin.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Hullo there. Enjoying your day off?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No. Douglas, how long ’til you land?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: About half an hour. Why?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Great. Is Arthur there?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, not <i>all</i> there.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Hello, Skip! This is weird, isn’t it? ’Cause normally when I’m here listening to someone on sat comm, you’re here too listening to them, only now you’re there where they are and I’m here where you usually are <i>and</i> where I usually am <i>and</i> am now, talking to you!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You find Arthur in philosophical mood, Captain.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Arthur, I need you to help me.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Brilliant! I <i>love</i> helping.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, this is a <i>big</i> help – a <i>very</i> big help.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No problem, Skip. I am a very big helper.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, Arthur ... Um, Douglas, are you still listening?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I don’t have an enormous amount of choice, Martin.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Can’t you put your fingers in your ears?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, heaven knows I’m not generally a stickler for safety procedures, but I’m not certain that’s a good idea whilst flying an aeroplane.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(tetchily)</i>: Fine. <i>(He sighs.)</i> Arthur, I’m at Fitton Hospital.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh no! Are you all right?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No. I’ve sprained my ankle.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh dear. How did you do that?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I was ... it doesn’t matter how.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Mmmmmartin?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(defensively)</i>: Look, it’s a perfectly valid tool when teaching best safety practice to demonstrate the wrong way as well as the right way.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You twisted your ankle whilst teaching someone how <i>not</i> to twist their ankle?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... Anyway. Arthur, you know how – although I’m mostly a pilot – I’m also a bit of a man with a van?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, today – right now, actually – I’m supposed to be picking up a piano in Fitton and delivering it to a pub in Devon.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Wouldn’t have thought you could do that with a sprained ankle.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, Arthur, I can’t. This is where the ‘you helping me’ part comes in. My van is at the airfield and the addresses and the spare van keys are in my pigeonhole.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Spare Van Keys – didn’t we fly him to Amsterdam once?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Douglas, shush. Arthur, when you land, do you think that you could ... <i>(he hesitates momentarily)</i> ... cou-cou-could you pick them up, find my van, pick me up at the hospital, drive me to Fitton, load a piano and then ... <i>(he takes a long breath)</i> ... drive me to Ottery St Mary?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(nonchalantly)</i>: Yeah, no problem. All right, bye.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Really, Martin? Arthur? Is this wise?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(indignantly)</i>: Hey!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I-I know, I know! But I don’t have a choice.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Double hey! I can do it!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Would it be worse for you to cancel the job, or to rely on Arthur – <i>Arthur</i> – to pick up and drive a piano – a <i>piano</i> – two hundred miles in a van – a <i>van</i>?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Why shouldn’t I?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Because, Arthur, you’re a clot.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(indignantly)</i>: I’m <i>not</i> a clot! ... What’s a clot?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, you know the way that you are and the things that you do?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Those are the ways of a clot.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Douglas, you’re forgetting: I’ll be there with him the whole time, supervising.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, then, what can <i>possibly</i> go wrong?(!)
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yeah, but there’s no-one else to ask!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No-one?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No.
        <br><i>(Douglas clears his throat pointedly.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Really?! <i>Would</i> you?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, I’ve nothing else to do today and it’s always useful to have someone owe you a colossal favour.
        <br><i>(Martin grunts)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: But <i>I</i> can still come, right?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Of <i>course</i>!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Er, <i>really</i>, Douglas?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh yes! I see my role as very much a managerial one with perhaps a little light driving. If you want actual piano-shoving done, we’ll need a piano-shover.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Brilliant!
        <br>
        <br>********
        <br>
        <br><i>(MJN’s portacabin door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ah, yes? Oh, hello, you two.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Hi, Mum. Er, Gerti’s all hoovered and locked up, so can I go to Devon?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Devon?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah. Er, Martin and Douglas are taking a piano to somewhere called ... er, what was it ... um ... Weasels King Henry? Hedgehog O’Brien?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ottery St Mary.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah ... and they’ve said I can come too. Can I go, Mum?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Arthur, you are twenty-nine years old. You don’t need my permission to go to Devon.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... Is that a yes?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: You won’t be bored all day without me?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I’ll struggle through.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Excellent! All right, then, Arthur – you get the keys and addresses; I’ll seek out the van.
        <br><i>(They leave the portacabin. Carolyn picks up the phone and dials.)</i>
        <br><b>HERC</b> <i>(answering at the other end)</i>: Hello? Herc Shipwright.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ah, Herc. It’s Carolyn Knapp-Shappey here. Are you still free today?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Oh, hello. Yes, I am.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, well, to my great disappointment, various better offers have fallen through and I am, in fact, reluctantly available for that lunch and dog walk you were nagging me about.
        <br>
        <br>********
        <br>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, this is it – The Laurels.
        <br><i>(The doorbell is rung.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Now let me do the talking, all right?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Of course.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Right-o.
        <br><i>(The door is opened.)</i>
        <br><b>LADY</b>: Hello.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Good morning, madam. I am Doug, this is Mart and Arth. We are your Man with a Van – or, rather, Men with a Ven.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Hello. I-I’m sorry, ignore him. I’m Martin Crieff. We’re from Icarus Removals.
        <br><b>LADY</b>: Oh, right, you’re here for the piano.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: “Icarus”?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, that’s right.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You do know what happened to Icarus, don’t you?
        <br><b>LADY</b>: It’s in here. Wipe your feet.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Thank you very much. <i>(Hissing to Douglas)</i> Of <i>course</i> I do!
        <br><i>(The door shuts behind them as they go in.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: So you’ve deliberately named your company after the first bad pilot in history?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(through gritted teeth)</i>: Shut up!
        <br><b>LADY</b>: Here it is.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: A-ha!
        <br><i>(He plays a dramatic flourish on the piano.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah, not bad. She’ll be wasted in a pub.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Wow! Douglas, that’s amazing! Ooh, now do <i>Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines</i>!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Absolutely not.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, but it’s my favourite!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Anyway, I don’t know how it goes.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah, you <i>must</i> do! Umm ... <i>(He sings tunelessly)</i> ♪ Up, down, flying around! Looping the loop and defying ... <i>(he snatches a breath)</i> ... the ground! ♪
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: If anything, I now know how it goes even less. But I can do you a little Chopin.
        <br><i>(He begins to play a perfect rendition of Chopin’s Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, thank you, Douglas. This lady wants us to move it, not show off on it.
        <br><b>LADY</b>: Oh, I don’t mind. Isn’t he good?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(continuing to play)</i>: You’re too kind.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Actually, we’re on rather a tight schedule.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes. Seven hours to drive two hundred miles. Every second counts.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Douglas, <i>please</i>.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Certainly, Icarus.
        <br><i>(He deliberately plays a mis-chord, then stops.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: All right, Arthur, snap to it. Arthur provides the brawn of our little operation, madam. I – you may not be entirely surprised to learn – am the brains.
        <br><b>LADY</b>: He doesn’t look very brawny.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: True, but that’s nothing compared to how much he’s not brainy.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Hey!
        <br><b>LADY</b>: And what’s <i>he</i> for?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Martin? Ah, Martin here has perhaps the most important thing of all.
        <br><b>LADY</b>: What’s that?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: A <i>van</i>.
        <br>
        <br>********
        <br>
        <br><i>(A doorbell rings, then the door is opened)</i>
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Hello, Carolyn.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, there you are. You’re late.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: We didn’t set a time.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You’re later than I imagined you’d be.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Then you clearly don’t have a very vivid imagination.
        <br><i>(Carolyn’s dog starts yapping.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(crooning)</i>: Hello, darling. Did you hear the silly late man?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Oh, hello. What a ridiculous dog.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I’m sorry?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: I said you have a ridiculous dog.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: My dog is <i>not</i> ridiculous.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Then whose dog is <i>this</i>? <i>(To the dog)</i> Hello there. <i>(To Carolyn)</i> What is she?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: She is a cockerpoo.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Oh! A cockerpoo. Obviously I’d never have called her ‘ridiculous’ had I known she was a cockerpoo(!)
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: It is a cross between a poodle and a ...
        <br><b>HERC</b>: ... cockatoo?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: A cocker spaniel. And she’s <i>not</i> ridiculous. She happens to be a noble and faithful hound.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Mmm-hmm. What’s she called?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... Doesn’t matter.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: What?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Her name is not important. Right – I thought we’d have lunch first, then walk after.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Oh. I’d rather walk first, work up an appetite.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Fine. I’ll see you when you finally get to the pub then. I’ll be the one looking full.
        <br>
        <br>********
        <br>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(closing the van door)</i>: All right. Are we ready to go?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yep.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Jolly good. Pre-driving to Devon checklist, Captain? Doors?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Closed.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Seatbelts?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: On.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Piano?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Checked.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Piano?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Cross-checked.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Jellybabies?
        <br><i>(Martin opens a bag of jellybabies.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Jellybabies to manual.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Excellent! Then off we go.
        <br><i>(He starts the van and pulls away.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I, um, I-I would have helped with the loading, you know, but it’s only ... this, this ankle is ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It’s quite all right. We managed.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I’m impressed you got the owner to do so much of the lifting.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes, she had a sort of wiry strength for her age.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I didn’t know you could play the piano, Douglas.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, you remember that time when there was that thing you didn’t know whether or not I could do, and then it turned out that I couldn’t?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No, nor do I.
        <br><i>(They drive on for a moment, then Martin hisses in a panicked breath through his teeth and whimpers.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Er, nothing. It’s just, uh, a bit close to that Volvo.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(reprovingly)</i>: Martin!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, no, no, don’t bite my head off but the van’s probably wider than you’re used to driving.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I am used to driving an <i>aeroplane</i>.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Not on the A46.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yellow car.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Nothing. Just ‘yellow car’.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Why did you say ‘yellow car’?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: There was a yellow car.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: But why did you <i>say</i> ‘yellow car’?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: You’ve got to say ‘yellow car’ when there’s a yellow car.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Why?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: That’s how you play Yellow Car.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I’m not <i>playing</i> Yellow Car.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: You’re <i>always</i> playing Yellow Car.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: And how – though I fear I can guess – <i>does</i> one play Yellow Car?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Right, well, imagine you’re driving along ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: We <i>are</i> driving along.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh yeah. OK, so now you look at the cars as they come along in the other direction and they’re all different colours, so, for instance, now, er, that one’s white; that one’s blue; that one’s a sort of metally-grey ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... and when you see a yellow car, you say, “Yellow car.”
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(indignantly)</i>: How did you know?!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: A wild stab in the dark.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: And then what?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: You start again.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: So how does it end, this game?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: It <i>never</i> ends.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: That’s very much what I feared.
        <br>
        <br>********
        <br>
        <br><b>WAITRESS</b>: Are you ready to order?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Yes, I think so. I’ll, um, I’ll have the mushroom and aubergine risotto.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Eugh!
        <br><b>HERC</b>: What do you mean, “Eugh”?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, you’ve seen they have proper food here as well.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Nevertheless ...
        <br><b>WAITRESS</b>: Any starter?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Greek salad, please.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, don’t tell me you’re a vegetarian?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: I <i>will</i> tell you that because I <i>am</i> one.
        <br><b>WAITRESS</b>: And for you, madam?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: That’s very disappointing. Why on Earth?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Carolyn, all through human history, we’ve been wrong about equality and we thought we were right. “All men are equal, except slaves, obviously.” “Oh, no, wait – all men are equal except black ones, obviously.” “No! No, wait – all <i>people</i> are equal except women, obviously.” Look, are you not at all curious about what we’re still getting wrong? And don’t you think there’s a good chance it’s “All <i>lives</i> are equal except animals, obviously”?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: That’s an eloquent argument.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Thank you.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I mean, it’s childish, specious, and the bit where you compare animal rights with universal suffrage is frankly offensive, but it’s superficially eloquent.
        <br><b>WAITRESS</b>: Shall I come back?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No-no-no. No, I’m ready. I’ll have the rack of lamb.
        <br><b>WAITRESS</b>: And to start?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: The whitebait.
        <br><b>WAITRESS</b>: Certainly.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Um, out of interest, about how many whitebait do you get in a serving?
        <br><b>WAITRESS</b>: About thirty, madam.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Gosh, imagine that: thirty little lives on a plate. Yum yum.
        <br>
        <br>********
        <br>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: OK: so as long as we average at least eleven miles an hour, we should get to Ottery St Mary by six.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, it’s a punishing pace but I think I’m up to it.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Why’s it called that, then, Skip?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ottery St Mary.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I’ve no idea.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Do <i>you</i> know, Douglas?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Do you?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Certainly I do. You see, St Mary is the patron saint of Devon and she, of course, was famously martyred by being eaten alive by otters.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Really?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh yes – <i>rabid</i> otters. So she’s always portrayed in pictures absolutely covered in otters.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: What, eating her?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Sometimes, in the more fire and brimstone churches. Elsewhere, the assumption is they’re all in heaven now and have made up, so they’re just shown milling about her, nuzzling her affectionately and offering her ottery kisses and gifts of haddock.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Douglas ...
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Why would the otters go to heaven if they ate a saint?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You’ve put your finger, Arthur, as is so often your way, on the crux of a thorny theological problem. So far, our best guess is simply that St Peter’s got a real soft spot for otters. He looks into those whiskery faces and goes, <i>(in an affectionate voice)</i> “You guys! I can’t stay mad at you!” and lets them into heaven.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: So heaven is full of otters!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: More than you can possibly imagine.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: So, in your case, Arthur, probably be about twelve.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Hey, I can imagine <i>loads</i> of otters!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Really? How many?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: A million!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You see, I don’t think you <i>can</i>. I don’t think <i>anyone</i> can.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I <i>can</i>. I’m doing it now! <i>(Long pause) Wow!</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No, you’re just imagining a <i>lot</i> of otters and then saying that’s a million. I don’t think <i>anyone</i> can actually genuinely imagine more than about twenty otters at a time.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, come on. I mean, I can definitely imagine a hundred otters.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Mmm, me too, yellow car.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: All right. How much space do they take up?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Er ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Could you, for instance, get a hundred otters on board Gerti?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, I reckon you could.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: And is it a jam-packed RSPCA-nightmare of a plane, or are the otters lounging in relative comfort?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, OK, there’s, er, there’s sixteen seats, so, say, two to a seat.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: They’re good friends, these otters?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Let’s hope so. Then one in each overhead compartment ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Always remembering to open them with care because otters may have shifted during the flight.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: And, er, one under each seat?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes! Good thinking.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: But that’s where the lifejackets are.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: That’s all right – otters can swim. Now, how many in the galley?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Er, four on the floor, two on the worktops? Well, it depends – are we carrying Carolyn and Arthur?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: To wait on the otters? I think that would be an indulgence, frankly. I think we’d be better off replacing them with more otters.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Might be better off replacing Arthur with an otter anyway!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(indignantly)</i>: Hey!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: So, thirty-two in the seats, sixteen in the overhead lockers, sixteen under the seats, six in the galley ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... fifteen in the hold?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, twenty easily; and six or seven in the aisle.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Call it seven.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: That’s, what, ninety-seven; and three in the flight deck. A hundred!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Brilliant!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No. Not in the flight deck.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Hypothetically, though ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I don’t care <i>how</i> hypothetical it is, I’m not flying with a live otter in the flight deck.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I don’t see why not. Historically, very few hijackings have been carried out by otters.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, I’m sorry, but I don’t think the Civil Aviation Authority would be too keen on the idea.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: To be quite honest with you, Captain, I don’t think there’s a whole lot about this plane full of unsupervised otters the CAA is going to love.

        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(gasping)</i>: We ... have been pushing ... your piano.
        <br><b>MR HARDY</b>: What?! That’s no way to treat it! <i>Where</i> have you been pushing it?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(hurriedly)</i>: Only from our van.
        <br><b>MR HARDY</b>: Where <i>is</i> your van?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: We parked it round the corner.
        <br><b>MR HARDY</b>: Why did you ...?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(talking over him)</i>: So if you’d care to sign here, sir ...
        <br><b>MR HARDY</b>: Hold your horses. Let’s take a look at it.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Of course.
        <br><b>MR HARDY</b> <i>(walking around the piano)</i>: Uh-huh. Yeah. Yep, that’s fine. Let’s just check in here.
        <br><i>(He lifts the lid and hits a few random keys.)</i>
        <br><b>MR HARDY</b>: Ooh.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Everything all right?
        <br><b>MR HARDY</b>: Well, yes, but what are <i>these</i> doing on the keys?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What?
        <br><i>(There’s the jingling of car keys as Mr. Hardy picks them up.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh. Douglas. The van keys!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah yes. Well, that’s good.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: You must have closed the lid on them, Douglas, when you finished playing to Mum.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: So it seems. Still ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: After Arthur gave them <i>back</i> to you.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Like I <i>said</i> I gave them back to you.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... Yes.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, Douglas. You <i>CLOT</i>!
