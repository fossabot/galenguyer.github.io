        <br><i>(Radio on.)</i>
        <br><b>FITTON AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL</b>: Golf Tango India, I’m gonna clear you to start after Golf Echo Echo.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(into radio)</i>: Thank you, Karl. Ready to go after Golf Echo.
        <br><b>KARL</b>: That’s Golf Echo Echo.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Sorry, Tower. I thought the second ‘Echo’ <i>was</i> an echo.
        <br><b>KARL</b>: What?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I thought you said <i>‘Golf Echo’</i> ... ‘echo’ – when in fact you said, <i>‘Golf Echo Echo.’</i> That is to say, I thought the first <i>‘Echo’</i> was <i>‘Echo’</i> and the second ‘Echo’ was an echo of <i>‘Echo’</i>; whereas in fact both <i>‘Echo’</i>s were <i>‘Echo’</i>s and neither <i>‘Echo’</i> was an echo.
        <br><b>KARL</b>: Then perhaps I’d better put you right to the back of the queue while you check your radio equipment, shall I?
        <br><i>(Slight pause.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... Golf Tango India ready to follow Golf Echo Echo.

        <br>This week, Helsinki!
        <br>
        <br><i>(Douglas is humming the tune </i>English Country Garden<i> as he moves something around in the flight deck.  The flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh! Hello Douglas. Good lord!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah. Morning, Martin. I wasn’t expecting you just yet.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Evidently not!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Have you picked up the weather?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Er, yes. North Sea turbulence; clear skies at Helsinki.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, jolly good.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Douglas, I can’t help but notice you’ve filled the flight deck with orchids.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes. Yes, I <i>have</i> done that. Yes.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Are you about to propose to me?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It pains me to break your heart, Martin, but no. These are for <i>another</i> man – a Finnish customs officer named Milo, to be exact.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(getting on his pretend high horse)</i>: And what does he have that I don’t have?!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Fish cakes.
        <br><i>(Martin chuckles.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Really?!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Also salmon, turbot and langoustine.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, Douglas, you’re not smuggling again?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Absolutely not. Perish the thought! A simple exchange of gifts. You see, a friend gave me these orchids when we were in Cyprus, as a token of appreciation for the sixteen jars of Béarnaise sauce I gave <i>him</i>; which were in turn an unwanted gift from a friend in Marseilles. The orchids are lovely but not quite my thing, so I shall pass them on to my friend in Helsinki and – who knows? – he may wish to show his gratitude by presenting me with assorted fish and fish products, which will be just the very thing for a friend of mine in Zurich. They’re rather short of fresh seafood in Switzerland – don’t know why(!)
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I see. But if you just keep bartering each thing along, what’s the point?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, put it this way: I have here about five hundred Euros’ worth of flowers, and I shall exchange them for about five hundred and sixty Euros’ worth of fish; and I started three months ago with a cheese sandwich. Right – that’s most of them hidden away. Could you put this bunch under your seat?
        <br><i>(Martin groans as he takes the bunch from Douglas.  The flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(cheerfully)</i>: Good morning, good morning, good morning, gents! Teas, coffees? Keys, toffees?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Morning, Arthur. You seem a little low-spirited.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Do I?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(flatly)</i>: No.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What is it this time? Have the numbers you <i>would</i> have picked in the Lottery come up again?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, that was a great day, wasn’t it? Sixty thousand pounds!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: That you didn’t win.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: But that’s what my numbers were worth! Brilliant! No, no, nothing like that. No, er, let’s just say I’m <i>really</i> looking forward to meeting our passenger today.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ooh, who is it? Let’s see ...
        <br><i>(He consults a sheet of paper.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Mr. Arthur Milliner. A stockbroker. Yes, he sounds <i>enormous</i> fun.
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(grumpily)</i>: Oh, you’re here already. What are you doing in here?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Arranging flowers.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: <i>Don’t</i> get sarcastic with me.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Sorry, Carolyn.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Scusey. Back in a minute.
        <br><i>(Flight deck door closes.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Right, you’ve got clear skies at Helsinki; your alternate is Stockholm; Douglas, you operate out.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Wilco. Who’s this Milliner chap we’re flying, then? Arthur seems very keen to meet him.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No idea. Internet booking. Payment’s gone through fine, though, so, er ...
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Happy birthday!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, yes!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You remembered!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Happy birthday.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, happy birthday.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: You thought I’d forgotten, didn’t you?!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, I-I wasn’t sure.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Of course not! Not a special birthday like this one!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What’s so special about sixty-three?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, you know, because of the song. <i>(Singing to the tune of </i>When I’m Sixty Four<i>)</i> ♪ Do you still like me? / Can you still see me? / Now I’m sixty-three! ♪
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah, <i>that</i> song. Carolyn, you’re aware I <i>had</i> forgotten, aren’t you?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes! Don’t worry. I forgot to put any money on your expenses card. Paying for your own hotel room can be <i>your</i> present.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: That’s ... that’s a very <i>big</i> present!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I <i>know</i>! I’m <i>such</i> a lucky girl! You shouldn’t have(!)
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: <i>I</i> didn’t forget.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Didn’t you?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Didn’t</i> you?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No – I ... hid my present under my seat. It’s ...
        <br><i>(He produces the bunch of flowers.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... these.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, <i>orchids</i>! How <i>lovely</i>!
        <br><i>(Martin laughs nervously.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Gosh. How generous of you, Martin.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Not <i>that</i> generous.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Pretty</i> generous. Orchids are very expensive.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: <i>Quite</i> expensive – not all that expensive.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You’d be surprised.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No I wouldn’t.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes you <i>will</i>.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: <i>My</i> present, though – time for <i>my</i> present.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, I’m sorry, dear. What is it?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, it’s a pretty special one, and it’s in the cabin. So, are you ready?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Mum, it’s been fifteen years since you’ve seen her, but today, for your birthday, get ready to meet ...
        <br><i>(He opens the flight deck door.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... your sister Ruth!
        <br><i>(Long silence.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: And her husband Philip, and her grandson Kieran!
        <br><i>(Another long silence.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Hooray!
        <br><b>KIERAN</b> <i>(sounding teenaged, with a fairly posh accent)</i>: Aren’t you going to say anything to her, Granny?
        <br><b>RUTH</b> <i>(northern English accent)</i>: Well, Kieran, when a lady is asked to drive a hundred and fifty miles to meet her sister, she naturally assumes it’s because her sister has something to say to <i>her</i>.
        <br><i>(Slight pause.)</i>
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: But evidently not.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Arthur, during your no doubt meticulous planning of this occasion, did it occur to you that if two sisters haven’t spoken for fifteen years, there might be a <i>reason</i> for it?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ah. Well, regrettably, you’ll have to tell your aunt she’s wasted her time. We’re about to leave for Helsinki and I have much to do.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: A-ha! That’s the second part of my present.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(excitedly)</i>: I booked the trip! So we can all go together!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: <i>You</i> booked the trip?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>You’re</i> Arthur Milliner?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yes!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ‘Milliner’? Why ‘Milliner’?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Because it’s not <i>my</i> name, but it sounds like a name that someone might have.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: And ‘Arthur’?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: That was the clever bit! It’s the last name you’d expect me to use, because it actually is my name!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: To be honest, Arthur, I think the moment you decided to book your aunt on a fake flight to Helsinki, you had us on the back foot, expectations-wise.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Arthur, a word with you in the galley.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... I don’t want to.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: <i>I</i> want you to.
        <br><i>(Door closes. [Transcriber’s note: this doesn’t make sense.  They must be in the cabin at this point because they can’t all be crammed into the flight deck, and the galley is only separated from the cabin by a curtain.  A rare sound effects gaffe, I think.])</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh dear. This is a little awkward, isn’t it?
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: It’s not awkward for <i>me</i>.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh good(!) Just the rest of us, then.
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: No! No, it’s not awkward for my husband; it’s not awkward for my grandson. We’ve nothing to feel awkward about. We accepted an invitation in good faith.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... So, Philip, what line of work are you in?
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: My husband’s deaf.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah. That explains much.
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: <i>What</i> does it explain?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Why he can’t hear me.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: Are you the captain?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No, I’m the first officer. This is the cap...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(interrupting)</i>: <i>I’m</i> the captain.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: You’re very young to be a captain.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(exasperated)</i>: Oh, for goodness’ sake! You’re an actual child!
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: No, I mean, wow! You’re very young to be a captain! Did you display exceptional leadership skills and goal focus?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Ah, well, it’s, er, not for me to say.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(resignedly)</i>: And yet, and yet.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: Because I <i>also</i> displayed exceptional leadership skills and goal focus, and that’s a verbatim quote from my report. Are you prepared to share the techniques of your success?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, well. Yes, there’s probably a tip or two I can pass along. What do you say we have you up on the flight deck once we get underway, eh?
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: I am <i>delighted</i> to accept!
        <br><i>(Martin chuckles.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: And the small matter of the anti-terrorism laws, Captain?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(airily)</i>: Oh, let’s not get too hidebound by rules and regs, eh, Number One?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ‘Number One’?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... Douglas.
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: And when <i>will</i> we be getting under way, might I ask?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah. Of course, not having seen your sister for so long, it’s possible you may have missed certain subtle signs just now that would warn the experienced Carolyn-watcher not to bank on seeing Helsinki today. Sorry to rain on your parade, Martin.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No-no-no, <i>my</i> parade’s fine. Bone dry. Bad news for the import/export parade, though, I’d have thought. I wonder how long fresh orchids keep?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah. Excuse me for a moment.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And how did you even <i>pay</i> for it?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: With a credit card online.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You don’t <i>have</i> a credit card.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: <i>Your</i> credit card.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: <i>My</i> credit card?!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No, no, because it doesn’t matter, because it’s your plane, so you’re just paying yourself! It’s free!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: The fuel’s not free. The landing fees are not free. The business we <i>would</i> have had if Mr. Arthur ‘Idiot’ Milliner hadn’t been hogging the plane isn’t free!
        <br><i>(Galley curtain opens.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ah, Douglas, good. Arthur, go and tell Ruth and her hangers-on to sling their collective hook.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Okay. Sorry, Mum.
        <br><i>(Door closes.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And Douglas, cancel the flight plan.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Are you sure?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Of <i>course</i> I’m sure! I’m not spending time and fuel taking my rotten sister on a jolly to Finland.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You know best ... but she <i>did</i> come all this way.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Because she smelled a freebie!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Maybe. She still came, though. And then there’s Arthur – internet booking, pseudonyms, secret phone calls to Lancashire. That’s a lot of work he put in – especially for an idiot.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Douglas, call me a cynical old bat ...
        <br><i>(Douglas draws in a breath.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Don’t even think about it – but is it entirely without the bounds of possibility that you have an ulterior motive for this trip going ahead?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Carolyn, I hope you know me better than that. At any given moment I never have fewer than <i>seven</i> ulterior motives under way; but even so ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Would I have to talk to her?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Flying her to Finland in silence might seem a <i>little</i> eccentric.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: ... and not just for the petrol, mind; there’s Philip’s loss of earnings to think of; there’s general wear and tear ...
        <br><i>(Door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: So. Ruth.
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: I’m sorry – is somebody talking to me?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes. <i>I’m</i> talking to you.
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: Well. <i>Thank</i> you.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: For what?
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: For accepting you were in the wrong.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I didn’t!
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: Well, you implicitly <i>did</i> by being the first to speak.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No I didn’t!
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: Well, you did, so apology accepted.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Apology not given.
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: Apology <i>still</i> accepted. Now, what did you want?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: All I want is to tell you <i>exactly</i> where you can go, Ruth, and <i>that</i> is ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(mildly)</i>: Carolyn.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... to Helsinki. Would you ... would you like to go to Helsinki?
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: Well, I suppose now we’re here – <i>and</i> you’ve apologised ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I haven’t.
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: All right, then.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(not happily)</i>: Good.
        <br><b>RUTH</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Hooray!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Incidentally, Arthur: why on earth Helsinki?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, I’ve just always wanted to go to Helsinki. It sounds really fun!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What have you ever heard about Helsinki?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Nothing! I mean the name! Helsinki! How could you not have fun in Helsinki! It’s like half-helter-skelter and half-twinkly!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I’ve always thought it sounds like a sink in hell.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, now you’ve spoiled it.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><b>FITTON ATC</b>: Golf Tango India, join the visual circuit at three thousand feet; turn left, follow your nose, and if you get lost, stop and ask.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes, thank you, Karl. Roger.
        <br><i>(Radio off.  Flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Er, chaps, er, little chap here said, er, you said he could come up.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: I’m not a little chap!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yes you are.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh yes! Come on in, Kieran.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Er, Skipper says you can go in.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: Yes, I heard him.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Um, it’s my job to tell you.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: What a stupid job!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No, <i>you’ve</i> got a stupid job.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: I’m at school.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(defensively)</i>: ... <i>Yeah.</i>
        <br><i>(Flight deck door closes.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Kieran! Hello. Sit yourself down there. We call that the jump seat.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: Yes, I know.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Okay. So, this array of screens and dials might look <i>very</i> imposing, but it’s actually not so <i>very</i> different ...
        <br><i>(Kieran begins to chuckle and continues to do so.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... from your ... dad’s ... car. What?
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: I’m sorry. It’s just I have Microsoft Flight Simulator X Deluxe edition. I do three to four hours’ training every day.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Playing</i>, you mean.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: No – I use it as a training tool.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Mmm, but it’s a game, so ... <i>playing</i>.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: Anyway, I’m-I’m probably familiar with more flight instrument layouts than you are.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(laughing)</i>: Well, I doubt it, actually. I’ve <i>also</i> got Flight Simulator.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: Oh, which edition?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(hesitantly)</i>: ... Ninety-five.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: And how often do you train on it?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Play</i> on it.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Most days.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Hang on, hang on, Martin. You come home after ten or twelve hours’ flying an aeroplane and then, to wind down, you sit in front of a computer and <i>pretend</i> to fly an aeroplane?
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: Perfectly sensible procedure. Allows you to revise infrequently-met hazards.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes! Exactly! You see, Douglas?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I see that your life meets with the approval of the obsessive fourteen year old boy.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: “Obsessive” is just a word the disorganised use for the focussed.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It’s not the <i>only</i> word they use.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Ignore him! Just ignore him. Now then: what did you want to ask me?
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: Er ... <i>(he clears his throat)</i> ... well. Let me start by getting an idea of your hinterland. What are your outside interests?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(slowly)</i>: Outside of what?
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: Outside flying.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: <i>Outside</i> flying?
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: You mean, what else am I interested in apart from flying?
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: Yeah. Like, er, for instance, I have grade seven lute, and I’m not even gonna <i>take</i> grade eight, ’cause my tutor says I’d be better off spending the time getting to concert standard.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: W-well, no, I don’t play the lute ...

        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, well, I suppose that’s true. I-I wouldn’t say it myself but, um ... well, that’s the English disease, isn’t it? We don’t celebrate our success; we don’t blow our own trumpet.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Can I just say, sir, how inspiring it’s been to watch you fight that disease?
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: Er, so: first things first. Which flying school did you go to?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Ah, you see, my story’s even more remarkable than that. I actually put <i>myself</i> through my P.P.L. and C.P.L.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: Interesting. You didn’t even think it was worth applying?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, well, I did <i>apply</i>.

        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I didn’t – I didn’t get an offer as such, at the time.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: Not “as such”?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... All right, not at all! So what? I did it the hard way. I did menial jobs and night shifts for <i>years</i> to save up for the flying hours and the instrument rating and ... then I saved up all over again to do the re-take.
        <br><b>KIERAN</b>: You failed your <i>instrument rating</i>?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I passed it eventually.
        <br><i>(Short pause.)</i>

        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: What?
        <br><b>CUSTOMS OFFICER</b>: You can’t bring it in. We have very strict rules about importing foods, and this definitely does not fit into any category we have – or will <i>ever</i> have.

        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Though I’m not sure you can claim to have arranged for the Northern Lights to be switched on for me.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: All I’m saying is: if anyone you knew <i>could</i>, who would it be?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, thank you very much.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(sadly)</i>: They’ve rather put my fishcake in the shade.

        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Hey!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: All right, the three of us.

        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Philip, I-I don’t know how to tell you this. We-we’ve left Ruth and Kieran in Helsinki.
        <br><b>PHILIP</b>: Oh. Well done you. <i>(He chuckles.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Hang on: I thought you were deaf?
        <br><b>PHILIP</b>: Shh. It’s a secret.
