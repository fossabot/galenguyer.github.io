        <br><i>(Bing-bong.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, our onboard transit process today has now reached its ultimate termination.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: He means we’ve landed.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yes. So, as yourselves prepare for disemboarding, if I could kindly ask you to kindly ensure you retain all your personal items about your person throughout the duration of the disembarkation.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: He means take your stuff with you.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: In concluding, it’s been a privilege for ourselves to conduct yourselves through the in-flight experience today, and I do hope you’ll re-favour ourselves with the esteem of your forth-looking custom going forward.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... No idea.

        <br>This week, Johannesburg!
        <br>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Okay, Martin, two miles to run. Descend to five hundred feet. Stand by for visual on target.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Douglas, are we <i>certain</i> about this?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Quite</i> certain.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(nervously)</i>: Right. It’s just ... I ... I’m sure it’s gonna be fine ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Excellent! I’m <i>also</i> sure it’s going to be fine.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: The thing <i>is</i>, though, I’m not sure it’s gonna be fine.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What an exquisite paradox. Luckily, though, I’m still <i>completely</i> sure it’s going to be fine; so as I’m a hundred percent sure and you’re fifty each way, that still gives us a comfortable hundred and fifty percent working majority.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Douglas!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Target in sight; level five hundred feet; left-left; waggle wings ... and open air brakes ... <i>now</i>!
        <br><i>(Slight pause.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What?! What?! What?! I can’t see! What happened?!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I may have <i>very slightly</i> over-estimated how fine it would be.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What were you <i>thinking</i>?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Look, all we were trying ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Shut up, Martin. Douglas, what were you <i>thinking</i>?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I just thought, since I had to <i>work</i> on my daughter’s birthday, it would be nice to do a little fly-past of her party on the way.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Barrow-in-Furness is not ‘on the way’ to Paris. So first you stole my aircraft ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I wouldn’t call it ‘stealing.’
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I paid you to fly three hundred miles south west. You flew it two hundred miles north east. What is that if not stealing?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Hijacking, at most.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Carolyn ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Shut up, Martin.
        <br><i>(Martin groans quietly.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: But, of course, you were just warming up! Because not only did you steal my aircraft, you then chose to mark your arrival at the children’s birthday party by dropping a bomb on it.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: The idea was perfectly sound!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: The idea was terminally stupid! Was it <i>your</i> idea, Martin?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No it wasn’t! Oh, and I’m allowed to speak again now, am I?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No – shut up.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It was <i>my</i> idea. It occurred to me that if we filled the air brake cavity with boiled sweets and then opened it just as we were flying over ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... you could strafe your daughter’s birthday party.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No, not ‘strafe’! We weren’t going anything like fast enough! We did <i>check</i>!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I did the calculations.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: And we were quite sure the sweets would flutter gently down to the excited children beneath. And so they <i>would</i> have done, <i>if</i> it hadn’t been rather a hot day and the sweets in the metal compartment hadn’t melted a little and then, up in the cold air, solidified again into a ... a ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... a sugar brick.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... which you dropped on your ex-wife’s house.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes ... but we were very lucky really. We could have hit her conservatory or her BMW.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Or a child!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Now, don’t exaggerate! All the children had run for safety long before it landed.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: That is not as reassuring a sentence as you seem to think.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I’m just saying we couldn’t have hit a child; but I admit we <i>could</i> have hit a car.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: But you <i>didn’t</i> hit a car, did you? You hit a <i>carp</i>.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... Yes.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Do you have any idea how much a koi carp costs?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I do <i>now</i>, yes. But don’t worry – I don’t expect you to pay for it.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You d...?! Of <i>course</i> you don’t expect me to pay for it! Why in heaven would <i>I</i> pay for it?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, as you pointed out, it is <i>your</i> plane.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes! And I paid you to use it to fly a franking machine to Paris, not to fly a multi-coloured confectionary brick to Cumbria and drop it on a fish.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, to be fair, we <i>did</i> go to Paris afterwards.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Martin. Really, shut absolutely up.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(resignedly)</i>: Right!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Look, both of you. I’m being serious – with my serious face. You <i>cannot</i> keep doing things like this. I will spell it out in words of one syllable. <i>(Pedantically)</i> If – you – waste – my – money – we – will – go – bust. You – will – have – no – job.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... ‘Cash,’ not ‘mon-ey.’
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: <i>Please</i>! Will you take this seriously? We can’t go on like this! Look at the trip budget you’ve submitted for Johannesburg next week: fourteen thousand pounds! Are we flying there on the backs of unicorns?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: It’s pared to the bone, I promise you! I can’t compromise safety for economy.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: That’s rich, coming from the Bomber of Barrow.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I’m sorry, Carolyn. It’s just that the captain and myself are deeply unmaterialistic. Our souls are rather beautiful that way, actually.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Is that so? All right, then, First Officer Gandhi: I’ll tell you what I’ll do. On a one-trip trial basis, if you can magically shave, say, two thousand pounds off that pared-to-the-bone budget, you can split it between you – which should just about pay for the carp – but if it comes in so much as a penny <i>over</i> twelve thousand pounds, <i>you</i> pay <i>me</i> a grand each. Deal?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Absolutely. Deal.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, wait! Douglas! The budget really <i>is</i> pretty tight. How on earth are we going ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, Martin. <i>Trust</i> me! Deal.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Chaps, my galley’s been burgled. They’ve taken the trolley, er, the duty free, the microwave, even the hot water boiler.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Sorry, Arthur, that was me. The lighter we keep the plane, the less fuel we need, so I’ve off-loaded all unnecessary dead weight. Speaking of which, how much do <i>you</i> weigh?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: But how am I supposed to heat up the catering?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, I’ve cancelled the catering.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: You cancelled our <i>food</i> for a twelve hour flight?!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Needless expense. Don’t worry – I rustled us up a little something myself.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, Douglas, you should have asked <i>me</i>.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Should</i> I, though, Arthur, really? The inventor of fizzy yoghurt?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: To be fair, I didn’t <i>invent</i> that so much as discover the process that makes it.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes. Yoghurt plus time. Here, take these.
        <br><i>(Sound of him handing Tupperware boxes to Arthur.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Right-o. Er, how do I prepare them?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Take lids off boxes; empty onto plates; give to pilots. <i>And</i> – and I can’t stress this strongly enough – do <i>nothing</i> else to it whatsoever.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Is that <i>really</i> gonna save us much money, Douglas?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Every little helps. Why, what have <i>you</i> come up with?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, er, had a good think last night, and I think so long as we get the <i>long</i> runway at Jo’burg, we <i>may</i> be able to land without using the wheel brakes.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I see. And that’ll save us what?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, it’ll prolong the life of the brakes.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: To the tune of ...?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... Obviously not in a ... calculable way.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Terrific(!) Well done.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, all right. What else have <i>you</i> come up with?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Turn off air conditioning; only take half the liquid oxygen; keep air recirculation fans on; and only use <i>one</i> engine to taxi – and I’m just getting warmed up.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: So, if doing those things saves money, why don’t we do it all the time?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, the most tiresome of pettifoggers might question whether it constituted absolute best practice.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: You mean it’s horrendously illegal.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ‘Horrendously’ is a strong word.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I notice you’re not quibbling ‘illegal.’
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Not <i>dangerously</i> illegal. It’s not like I’m suggesting we only <i>fly</i> on one engine – al<i>though</i> ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No!
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><i>(Sounds of eating.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(with his mouth full)</i>: This ... is <i>excellent</i>, Douglas! Did you really cook it yourself?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I did indeed.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Mmm! It’s lovely!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I’m very good at cooking.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Is there anything you’re <i>not</i> very good at?
        <br><i>(Silence.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Douglas?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I’m thinking. There <i>are</i> things I haven’t <i>tried</i> yet. I suppose it’s possible I’m not very good at some of those – theoretically.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, this is great. Unusual flavour – what is it?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Carp.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... But ... not ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: When <i>I</i> pay a thousand pounds for a fish, I don’t just throw it in the bin. Now then, when we get to Jo’burg, obviously we can save a lot on hotels.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: How?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: By not staying in one.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: So where will we sleep?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, I’m a happily married man, so I shall sleep in the plane; but <i>you</i>, m’lad, have four hours in hand to get yourself invited to the Johannesburgian bedroom of your choice.
        <br><i>(Martin chuckles, then quickly becomes serious again.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, I’ll sleep in the plane too.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: That uniform’s <i>wasted</i> on you, it really is.
        <br><i>(An alarm pings three times.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah! Fancy that.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Little flashing warning light, Captain. Anti-icing, the starboard wing, declaring itself Rabbit of Negative Euphoria.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What?!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Not A Happy Bunny.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(frantically)</i>: Right, okay, okay, okay! Isolate the anti-icing valves port and starboard. Prepare for landing and ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! We don’t need to divert. We can do without anti-icing.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No we can’t!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Martin, we’re currently flying over southern Spain. We’re about to fly the length of continental Africa. May I suggest that ice may <i>not</i> be our most formidable foe?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: You <i>know</i> perfectly well the hotter it is, the quicker ice will form if we fly through clouds.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: But I have a strategic master stroke to counter that: let’s <i>not</i> fly through any clouds.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: But there <i>are</i> clouds, look.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What, <i>those</i> little fluffies?! We could just weave in and out of those! And we only have to keep the <i>starboard</i> wing out of them, anyway. It’ll be fun!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, Douglas, we’re landing and getting it fixed.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You know what? I was <i>wrong</i> about the warning light. It’s not on. I made a mistake.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I can <i>see</i> it!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No, Martin. That’s an optical illusion caused by the fierce glare of the sun – the hot, Mediterranean ice-melting sun which will beat down on us as we pay landing fees and engineer’s fees, and hope they’ll fix us in time to get to Jo’burg tonight. In <i>Spain</i>. <i>Lovely</i> people, magnificent culture – not famed for their snap-to-it efficiency.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Look, I know, but I-I’m sorry, I <i>have</i> to.
        <br><i>(Douglas sighs in exasperation.  Radio on.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(into radio)</i>: Madrid, Golf Tango India. We have a system malfunction; require radar vectors to nearest suitable airfield.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><i>(Sound of GERTI’s engines shutting down, and the flicking of switches.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: And post-landing checks complete.
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Gentlemen. I can’t help but notice we’ve landed three hours after take-off, which means either you have discovered a hitherto-unsuspected warp drive button, or this isn’t Johannesburg.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Carolyn, I’m sorry. You can rant and rave all you like, but we <i>had</i> to divert. The anti-icing system was ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(mildly)</i>: Yes, fine, whatever you think.
        <br><i>(Startled silence for a moment.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Really?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, of course! I’m sure you had your reasons.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, yes, but don’t you want to hear them and then disagree with them? I thought you’d be more furious.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, it’s curious, isn’t it?! Curious I’m not furious! It turns out I mind losing money a lot less just so long as Douglas is losing it <i>too</i>.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: And me!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, but for some reason <i>you</i> losing money doesn’t make me happy the way <i>Douglas</i> losing money does.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, well ... thank you, I suppose.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You’re very welcome!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, sorry to disappoint you, Carolyn, but I have <i>no</i> intention of losing <i>any</i> money. The landing fees should be pretty light in a tiny airfield like this, and it doesn’t shut ’til five. Plenty of time for them to fix GERTI.
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Chaps, have we landed?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes, Arthur. Well spotted.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, er, since you’ve taken away my water boiler, can I order some hot water here?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, of course.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No-no-no.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, come on. I’m not flying the length of Africa without coffee. We need hot water.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Certainly, but we don’t need to pay thirty Euros for it. There’s an old flying school trick I know.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Of <i>course</i> there is(!)
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Arthur, get a wine bottle, fill it with water and, using the asbestos gloves, place it very carefully on the lip of one of the engine exhausts. Hey presto, boiling water.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Good heavens. Douglas has discovered his inner Womble.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: But ... doesn’t the air come out of the back of those engines pretty fast?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Arthur, the engines aren’t on. Clues to this include the aircraft being stationary on the ground and eerily quiet. But they’ll still be hot from the flight.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ah, right! Yes! Because I was thinking, otherwise I might have had a bit of a job ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... balancing a wine bottle in a fourteen hundred mile an hour jet blast. Yes, I imagine you <i>would</i>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b> <i>(Spanish accent)</i>: I am sorry. We have no engineer at this airfield.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Right. So what do you do when you need an engineer?
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: We call Diego out from the big airport at Albacete.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, can you do that now, please?
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: I <i>can</i> ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Then <i>do</i>.
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: ... but he won’t come.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Do you know, I think what I like about this conversation most, Douglas, is that you’re the one having to have it.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Why</i> won’t he come?
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: He cannot. His car is broke down.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: The <i>engineer’s</i> car has broken down?
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: That’s not a <i>terribly</i> good sign, is it?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, can we go and get <i>him</i>?
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: I suppose, but how? You have no car.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ah. He’s got you there.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Can we <i>hire</i> a car?
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: Not here. Maybe from the airport at Albacete.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: The place we want the car to get to.
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: It’s the nearest place.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Er, well, can we <i>borrow</i> a car?
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: Whose car?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, <i>I</i> don’t know! <i>Your</i> car!
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b> <i>(chuckling)</i>: No.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Why not?
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: It’s a nice car – a BMW.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, Douglas here has an excellent safety record with BMWs. Only last week, he didn’t drop a brick on one.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Carolyn, you’re really not helping.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I know! I’m not <i>trying</i> to. It’s fun this, isn’t it – chipping in from the sidelines? I can see why you’re so fond of it.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Señor Quintanilla.
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: <i>Si</i>.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Surely</i> there is a vehicle <i>somewhere</i> on this airfield we can pay you a hundred Euros to let us drive to Albacete and back?
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: Er, maybe there is <i>something</i>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><i>(Sound of a low-powered vehicle chugging along.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(cheerfully singing)</i>: ♪ Three men went to mow, went to mow a meadow! Three men, two men, one man and his dog ... ♪
        <br><i>(Silence, apart from the engine.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: That’s where you say, “Woof woof,” Skip.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No it isn’t.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I think it <i>is</i>. Because it’s just after the word, “dog,” and dogs go ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I mean I’m not saying, “Woof woof.”
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: It would cheer you up.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(angrily)</i>: We are driving across the Spanish plains in the heat of the day on a sixty mile round trip on unmade roads in a <i>baggage truck</i>. It’s gonna take more to cheer me up than saying, “Woof woof.”
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, if you’re sure. It always cheers <i>me</i> up. Can we have the air conditioning on, please?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(incredulously)</i>: The ai... There is no air conditioning! Why would you have air conditioning on a vehicle with no doors?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: To keep it cool.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Arthur, I’m ... I really am at the end of my tether here. Could you please just try your hardest not to say anything?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... really stupid.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No! Just <i>anything</i>.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, right. Will do, Skip. Ooh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: <i>Stop</i> it!

        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes. <i>(Quietly to himself)</i> ... and twenty-four plus, er, minus ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(talking over his calculations)</i>: Well, I won’t disturb you. Just wondered if you’d heard from Martin yet.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No. He’s not answering his phone. <i>Why</i> isn’t he answering? There’s no point even <i>doing</i> this if he’s not gonna be back in time.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh, don’t you worry. I’m <i>quite</i> sure he’ll successfully drive his baggage truck to Albacete, find and pick up the engineer, bring him back in plenty of time to fix the plane by five.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Do you think so?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Not even for a moment. There’s about six hundred ways that plan could go wrong, even if it wasn’t Martin doing it, and it <i>is</i> Martin doing it – with help, from Arthur.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(irritated)</i>: You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I honestly don’t know when I’ve enjoyed a trip more. I only wish I’d thought of this years ago. This way, if I lose, you lose – which takes the sting out of it enormously; and if I win, I win – and thus ... I win.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(sarcastically)</i>: How nice for you. Oh, blast.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: The running total for this trip: twelve thousand and fourteen pounds.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh dear.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Of course, when you said, “under twelve thousand,” you didn’t mean <i>literally</i> to the penny – that would be ridiculous. You meant “to the nearest hundred or so.”
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ahh. Your little face as you tried to look as if you remotely thought you might get away with that. A miss is as good as a mile, I’m afraid.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(determinedly)</i>: Right.

        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, o-okay. ... It’s just, because you weren’t doing anything, I thought you hadn’t seen. ... Umm, I still don’t really know what we’re waiting for.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I’m waiting for ... I’m waiting for <i>Douglas</i> to say something sarcastic and then sort it out.

        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I <i>know</i> that!

        <br><i>(Martin sighs in frustration.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(deepening his voice in an attempt to sound like Douglas)</i>: Er, I’m <i>glad</i> we’re stuck under this bridge.

        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(deep voice)</i>: That’s a <i>good</i> thing ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Stop it! You’re not helping. If it comes to that, what are <i>you</i> waiting for?

        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I <i>don’t know</i>!
        <br><i>(Sound of the other vehicle’s horn again, and angry shouting in Spanish.  Martin sighs again.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I mean ... all I can think of is, um ... i-i-is, I suppose we could – we could let the tyres down.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, right – and pretend we’ve got a puncture.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No – to lower our height a couple of inches.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(gasping with excitement)</i>: Yes, brilliant! Well-well, let’s do <i>that</i>!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, but what have I got wrong?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, have you got something wrong?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I <i>always</i> get something wrong; and if Douglas were here, he’d point out what.

        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Me especially.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Er, but I would appreciate it as a favour if you felt you could knock off a measly twenty Euros.
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: This is not a market! I’m not used to haggle. This is a fair price, yes? You do not think I try to cheat you?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No, no! Absolutely not! W-well, look, how about this, then: is there anything we could <i>do</i> around the airfield while we’re waiting that would be worth twenty Euros to you?
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: I suppose ... you could wash my car.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(angrily)</i>: I’m not gonna wash your car!

        <br><i>(Sound of a lever being pushed.  GERTI’s engine tone goes up a notch ... then there’s a loud bang, followed by smashing glass and then a car alarm.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Engine malfunction, number one.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Shutting down number one!
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b> <i>(over radio as the engine powers down again)</i>: What have you done? <i>What have you done?!</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(into radio)</i>: W-we don’t know! What’s happened? What did you see?
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: You have fired a missile from your plane!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Is anyone hurt?
        <br><b>SEÑOR QUINTANILLA</b>: My BMW! My BMW is hurt! You fire your missile straight into my car!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... Martin. In the course of your jog-round, did you happen to <i>instinctively</i> notice whether Arthur had retrieved the bottle of water from the engine exhaust?
        <br><i>(Martin whines in anguish.  There’s a snapping of plastic.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh Martin. You’ve broken your new shades.
