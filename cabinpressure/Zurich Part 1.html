        <br><i>(Reprise of the end of ‘Yverdon-les-Bains’)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> They offered me the job, Arthur. I can start in three months!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Wow! Skip! That’s absolutely ... just what you wanted! Great!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yeah, but it’s not great for anyone else, though, is it – you, or Carolyn, or Douglas, if I go and MJN folds.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, <i>we’ll</i> be all right. We’ll find stuff to do.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(hesitantly)</i>: Or ... I just might have been joking about getting an offer.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, right!
        <br><i><i>(He and Martin chuckle briefly.)</i></i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I don’t get it. Were-<i>were</i> you joking?
        <br><i>(A door opens)</i>
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Ah. They’re in here.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Martin!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well? How did it go?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I-I-I-I-I was just telling Arthur about it.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah, but I didn’t completely understand.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, then, tell <i>us</i>! Did you get in?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... They’re going to let me know.
        <br>
        <br>This week, Zurich!
        <br>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, obviously they’re going to let you know, but how do you <i>think</i> it went?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Ah, well, er, parts of it went ... well ...
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Good.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... but other parts ... n-not so well.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It’s as if we were there.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Skip, sorry, I’m still confused. When you said ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(rapidly interrupting)</i>: So-so-so overall who <i>knows</i> what they thought? No-one! Famously inscrutable, the Swiss, aren’t they? Like their-their-their clocks.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes, the legendary inscrutability of the cuckoo clock. Who can fathom its secrets?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: So, Skip, you <i>were</i> joking when you said ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(rapidly interrupting)</i>: Yes, Arthur. Just forget it.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh? What was the joke?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Nothing. Just a joke I made to Arthur. You wouldn’t get it.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>I</i> wouldn’t get it?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: But <i>Arthur</i> would get it?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Actually, I didn’t <i>totally</i> get it. But Skip said ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Look, could we just drop it?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: So when are they going to let you know?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, er, soon. I just need some time to ... er, th-<i>they</i> just need some time to think me ... er, over.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Oh, did they say that? Well, that’s a good sign.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, no, I mean they ...
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah, Skip, so just so I’m <i>totally</i> clear: when you said they offered the ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(loudly)</i>: All right, fine! Th-the truth is, they <i>did</i> tell me.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(sighing)</i>: They said no.
        <br><i>(Everyone else simultaneously makes sympathetic noises.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well then they’re idiots!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It’s their loss.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: So MJN can carry on just as before.
        <br><i>[And maybe then Martin will have more time to learn to <u>stop</u> calling it ‘M<u>G</u>N’ ...!]</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, yes, but ... <i>(in a sympathetic voice)</i> ... oh, I’m so sorry, Martin.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: There’ll be other chances.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, now I get the joke.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(warningly)</i>: Arthur ...
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Because just now Skip told me they <i>did</i> offer him the job, but the joke was, actually they didn’t. ... It’s quite a sad joke.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Martin.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What’s going on, Martin?
        <br><b>THERESA</b> <i>(calling out from a distance)</i>: Martin!
        <br><i>(Sound of footsteps running closer.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Theresa?
        <br><b>THERESA</b> <i>(excitedly)</i>: You did it! You did it! You did it!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I didn’t know you were ...
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: I wanted to surprise you. I just got your message. I’m so proud of you. You did it! Oh! Hello, everyone. Have you told them yet?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I-I think they’ve probably gathered, yes.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You got the job?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Er, yes. But ...
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yes!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Congratulations, Martin!
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Welcome to Swiss Airways.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Although, in that case, what was all that nonsense just now?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No, it was a joke, Mum! Am I the only one that gets Skip’s amazing jokes?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: It wasn’t a joke. It was ... I-I thought I perhaps maybe I ... maybe I <i>wouldn’t</i> take the job.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Why on earth not?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Because when I told Arthur, I realised ... I <i>can’t</i> take it. What would happen to you all?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What nonsense! Of course you’re taking it.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, but ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: It is a salaried job flying 737s for an international airline and living an hour from your girlfriend. It could only be more perfect for you if it came with a cartwheel-sized hat.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Oh. So you two are, um ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, sorry. Theresa, this is Herc, um, Carolyn’s ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(swiftly)</i>: ... friend.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I was going to say ‘sparring partner’. Herc, this is Theresa.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Pleased to meet you.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: She’s the princess of Liechtenstein.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: I don’t think she is, Arthur.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Actually, I a little bit am.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Oh! So sorry – I assumed Arthur had, er ...
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: No, don’t worry. I would have assumed the same.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Carolyn, I can’t ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No. If it helps, Martin, you’re fired. Oh – I’ve always wanted to fire someone. ... I thought it would be more fun.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Perhaps you’re mellowing in your old age.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You’re fired too, Douglas. Now that <i>was</i> fun.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What about Douglas? What’s gonna become of him?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Thank you, Martin, but I suspect I can dodge the workhouse. I rather think I’ll become a captain again.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Will you? Where?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Wherever, Hercules, wins the bidding war for my services.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Ah, of course.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: And what about Arthur?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Arthur will be fine.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah, don’t worry about me, Skip. I’ve got loads of ideas of things to be. Fisherman; er, magician; dog guy; or I might just take the, er, crazy golf thing professional.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: <i>Or</i> you could have my van.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Skip! Your dad’s van?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, I can’t very well take it to Zurich, so, I mean, if you wanted it ...
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Skip, I’d <i>love</i> it! Can I, Mum?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, I-I can actually sort of see you as a Man with a Van.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(excitedly)</i>: <i>Yes!</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Now, listen: you’ll probably need to replace the brake pads in a year or two, then.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Right-o, Skip.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: And, er, and, er, get good ones. If you skimp on that sort of thing, you’ll only pay more later.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Got it.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Also, when you change the oil, add half a cup of ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes, probably best make him a list, Martin.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And it’s <i>very</i> generous of you and much appreciated. So, there we are: everyone will be fine.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, but who’s gonna look after GERTI?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, whoever buys her, dear heart.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: You can’t <i>sell</i> her.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Really? What would you have me do with her: fashion her into a pleasing brooch?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: But not to Dad. You promise you won’t sell her to Dad?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Of course not! My awful ex, Theresa. Used to own GERTI. Keeps trying to buy her back.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Or <i>steal</i> her back, like he did in St Petersburg.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Oh, was that the time Martin landed with one engine?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: That’s right!
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: Yes – he’s often told me that story!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Not <i>that</i> often.
        <br><b>THERESA</b>: <i>Quite</i> often.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: So, happy endings all round. Martin gets his dream job, and MJN bows out on its own terms in a blaze of glory. Hurrah!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Doesn’t <i>feel</i> like a happy ending.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: It <i>is</i> a happy ending – just not a fairytale ending. We can’t expect that. Real happy endings are never simple.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yes they are. Like in ‘Finding Nemo’ when they find Nemo. Or in ‘Casablanca’ when the woman gets a go on the plane.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: It’s not!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I suppose maybe ‘The Jungle Book’ when you’re meant to be happy that Mowgli goes off with the boring girl to the human village instead of hanging out with Baloo and Bagheera. That’s a kind of sad happy ending.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, exactly.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ‘Exactly’?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I’ve no idea, but if it helps him.
        <br>

        <br><i>(GERTI’s cabin door opens)</i>
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Oh, you’re in here.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Er, yes.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Well, I thought you handled that superbly.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Mmm.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Well done. And they all took it terribly well – even Arthur.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: And actually I think Martin’s van might be just the right thing for him, if, er ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(broken-heartedly)</i>: Oh, Herc.
        <br><i>(Sound of her moving into his arms.)</i>
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Carolyn.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I knew this couldn’t go on forever but we always managed to keep going and now ... it’s over.
        <br><b>HERC</b> <i>(sympathetically)</i>: Oh, my darling.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And what am I going to do now?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Well, you know you can always move to Zurich with me.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(strongly)</i>: I don’t want to move to stupid Zurich!
        <br><b>HERC</b>: No, of course not. Silly me.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And its stupid clocks!
        <br><b>HERC</b>: <i>Very</i> stupid clocks.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I’m sorry. I like you, but what would I do with myself in Zurich? What will I do with myself anywhere?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: I – I understand, but, you know, Martin <i>really</i> must ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Of <i>course</i> I know that, you pillock! I just <i>said</i> all that, but in the privacy of what is still – for now – my own aeroplane, am I not allowed to be sad about it?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Of course you are. ... You know the thing we’ve agreed I should say only on special occasions because continued one-way repetition of it is always unhelpful and manipulative?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: This feels like a special occasion.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: I love you, Carolyn.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(drawing in a breath)</i>: I ... <i>(long pause)</i> ... know.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><i>(Sound of a plane in flight.)</i>
        <br><b>RICK</b> <i>(into radio)</i>: Thank you, Herm, this is Golf Romeo India Mike Yankee, airborne heading two one zero, direct Guernsey.
        <br><b>AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL</b> <i>(over radio)</i>: Roger, Mike Yankee, continue as cleared.
        <br><b>RICK</b>: And we’re away. You okay there, Doug?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(yawning)</i>: Yeah. D’you always start this early?
        <br><b>RICK</b>: Well, yeah. Delivering newspapers – gotta be there first thing.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: All right, here’s one: People Who Should Have Been Arch Enemies.
        <br><b>RICK</b>: You what?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I’ll start. Jon Snow and John Thaw.
        <br><b>RICK</b>: No, sorry, I don’t get it.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Arch enemies. You know, because of their names – Snow and ... Thaw.
        <br><b>RICK</b>: Are you all right, mate?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes, I’m fine!
        <br><b>RICK</b>: Great. Only I had an uncle started coming out with all weird stuff once. Turned out it was a stroke.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I am <i>not</i> having a stroke! It’s a game.
        <br><b>RICK</b>: A game?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes! You know, to pass the time.
        <br><b>RICK</b>: Yeah – I’m-I’m not really a games sort of person, to be honest.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... Right. And, er, are you the only first officer with the company?
        <br><b>RICK</b>: First officer? No, mate, I <i>own</i> it. If you get the gig, it’ll just be you and me.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: But ... I would be the captain?
        <br><b>RICK</b>: Never really had a <i>captain</i>.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Right, but obviously one of us will technically be in command of the plane?
        <br><b>RICK</b>: Well, I suppose that’d be me. Wouldn’t worry about it, though.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No, I won’t. So: how <i>do</i> we pass the time?
        <br><b>RICK</b>: I’d just rest up if I were you. It’s pretty full-on once we get there. We’ve only got thirty minutes turnaround each stop.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: That doesn’t sound too bad. Is there a café of some sort, or can we get coffee sent out?
        <br><b>RICK</b>: No, mate. We’ve only got thirty minutes to unload the plane.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(appalled)</i>: ‘Unload the plane’?
        <br><b>RICK</b>: Yeah.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Us</i>?
        <br><b>RICK</b>: Yeah. Who else?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>Anyone</i> else!
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <br><i>(Echoing voices)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And those two boxes are going to my house. Take them outside. Arthur’s bringing the van round. And ... <i>(she sighs)</i> ... that’s everything.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Wow. Doesn’t the office look empty without ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... anything in it? Yeah.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh! Unless I can interest either of you in buying a sunbleached print of two Spitfires fighting in a clear green sky. Martin? Obviously I’m mainly looking to you.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Er, no thank you, Carolyn; and that one’s not a Spitfire.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: How can you tell?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(quick fire for the first part of the sentence)</i>: Well, partly because of the wing shape, fuselage and markings, but mainly because Spitfires didn’t fight each other.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(calling from a distance)</i>: Martin, come on!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(loudly)</i>: Coming! <i>(Quietly)</i> I’ll give you a fiver for it.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Done.
        <br><i>(Outside the portacabin)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: So, Martin. How’s the conversion course?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, we’re ... you know, we’re only a week in. It’s all been CRM stuff so far. We learned our personal watchwords yesterday.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Gosh.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Apparently the perfect Swiss Airways pilot is calm, resourceful and decisive.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, I can see now why they picked <i>you</i>.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Hmm.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I’m sorry, Martin. I-I-I didn’t ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No-no-no, it’s-it’s okay, it’s okay. The same thing had crossed my mind.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: So you haven’t been in the sim yet?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh yes, once! Ah, Douglas, oh it’s amazing! The new 737s, they’re just incredible. After GERTI it’s-it’s-it’s like driving a Rolls Royce after years of driving a ...
        <br><i>(A vehicle drives up rapidly. The horn is beeped as the vehicle slows to a halt.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(calling out)</i>: Hi, guys!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh my <i>God</i>!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(opening the vehicle’s door)</i>: Ta-daa! It’s your van, Skip! <i>My</i> van! <i>Our</i> van!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Why is there a sort of evil hippo on it?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ooh, where?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Here, on the side.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh, that’s not a hippo! That’s Goofy! Why does no-one recognise Goofy any more?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Because of the horrendously disfiguring accident he’s apparently had?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: He’s not had an accident! I painted it myself.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes, I thought perhaps you did.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: But why?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ah-ha!
        <br><i>(He opens the rear doors.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Double ta-daa!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What are those?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ice lollies! Surprise! I’ve turned it into an ice cream van!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Arthur, you-you can’t <i>do</i> that.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I <i>did</i>, though.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: But it’s a Transit van! It’s for light removals!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I know, Skip, but I thought, ‘What do people like even more than moving house? Ice cream!’
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: So, <i>how</i> did you turn it into an ice cream van?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Pretty easy, actually. I bought ten boxes of lollies and an ice cream guy hat and I painted Goofy on it.
        <br><i>(Sound of Martin moving the boxes around)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Arthur, these are all Calippos.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah, they’re my favourites.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Why have you only got strawberry flavour?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ah, that’s me being clever. I’m not allowed strawberries, so I won’t be tempted to eat them! Come on, get in, get in!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(as they get into the van)</i>: No, but Arthur, you can’t just sell ice creams from any old van. You need a licence, a pitch ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: A freezer.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Er, no, no. No, I bought some cool bags. I think they’re basically the same thing. Oh, and, um, Skip, look what else I bought!
        <br><i>(He accelerates the van and then brakes sharply. Martin and Douglas cry out.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Arthur!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What did you do that for?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: See? I’ve had the brake pads replaced, like you said!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I said in a year or two.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah, and I did it straightaway. <i>And</i> I got the most expensive ones they had.

        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Two thousand pounds! Which is great, because that’s exactly what I had in the bank!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: You spent all your money on brake pads?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, yeah, but it’s okay. It’s an investment.

        <br><b>MARTIN</b>, <b>ARTHUR</b> and <b>THERESA</b> <i>(simultaneously and sounding anything but happy)</i>: Yeah.
        <br><i>(Office door opens again)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Carolyn! There you are.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ah, Douglas. Good news ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Whatever you do, don’t sell GERTI.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, that certainly takes the edge off the good news.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: You have? Already? How?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I certainly have. Eight grand to the scrap metal guy.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Cancel the sale.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What? Why?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Because I just spoke to Gordon. He <i>means</i> it. He’s seriously prepared to spend a quarter of a million on her.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: How do you know?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Because I offered to sell her to him.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What?!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, I was lying, obviously, but he went for it, which means she must be worth much much more than that.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: How could she possibly be?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, <i>I</i> don’t know. Maybe he hid something on her before you divorced.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What, that we haven’t found in thirteen years?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>I</i> don’t know. I just know she’s worth a lot of money to him.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: No, no, no, no. I’m sorry, Douglas. I’d love to believe it, but he’s just doing it to get back at me.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Men like Gordon do not get back at their ex-wives by giving them a quarter of a million pounds. Trust me, Carolyn. Am I ever wrong?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, repeatedly. Far more often than your relentless self-propaganda would have us believe.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Am I ever wrong about this sort of thing?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well ...
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Mum?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Carolyn?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... Oh, what the hell. Let’s get her back.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes!
        <br><i>(Arthur cheers.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Auctioneer?
        <br><b>AUCTIONEER</b>: I have a name, you know.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: It doesn’t interest me. Fetch me Bruce.
        <br><b>AUCTIONEER</b>: Bruce took off ten minutes ago.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ‘Took off’? How could he take off?
        <br><b>AUCTIONEER</b>: If you remember, madam, you sold him an aeroplane!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: But I need to speak to him, now!
        <br><i>(Sound of a phone dialling)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, hello. Is that Bruce? ... Yes, I just happen to know your new plane’s sat comm number. My name’s Douglas Richardson, and I have an offer to make you.
