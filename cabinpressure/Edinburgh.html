        <br><i>(Bing-bong.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(over cabin address)</i>: Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Apologies to those of you who have been watching the in-flight entertainment this evening. Unfortunately a mechanical fault seems to have developed and I’m afraid we will not be able to bring you the last half hour of our feature presentation. However, as luck would have it, I happened to see this film a couple of days ago; and I’m happy to tell you that the bald guy <i>was</i> in the pay of the Mob all along; and that that woman from <i>The West Wing</i> shot Bill Paxton, but they caught her in the end. I hope that helps.

        <br>This week, Edinburgh!
        <br>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And lastly, your roster for the next two weeks. On the eighteenth, you’re going to Oslo to pick up a CFO ...
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Wow! What, for government scientists to study?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: A <i>C</i>FO, Arthur, not <i>U</i>FO. Then nothing ’til the twenty-fourth when, I’m afraid, you’re taking a stag do to Rome.
        <br><i>(Martin and Douglas both groan.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, I know, I know. They bring us three millennia of art, culture and architecture; we bring them thirteen City boys to throw up on it. It is heart-breaking.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Where did you go for <i>your</i> stag night, Douglas?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Which one?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: <i>Any</i> of them.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, the first one was the best. Soho, nineteen seventy-seven, with my brother, Jeffrey Bernard, Peter Cook, and a Kink.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: What’s a kink?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: <i>One</i> of The Kinks.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Which one?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, I know nothing about pop music. Whichever one it is that can fit three golf balls in his mouth.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Hmm!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Anyway – after Rome, a little treat, because guess what’s happening on the twenty-eighth?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah! The Six Nations final!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Birling Day!
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Indeed it is.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(triumphantly)</i>: Yes!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ah. Of course. You hadn’t joined us by last Birling Day, had you?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What’s Birling Day?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Mr. Birling is a retired gentleman who lives in an enormous house in Sussex with his enormous pile of money and his enormous wife; and his big treat is that once a year, he hires us to take him to the Six Nations rugby final, wherever it is ... Where is it this year, Carolyn?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Edinburgh.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: ... where he proceeds to get heroically sloshed and spends the rest of the year sleeping it off.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... Right. So what’s so special about that?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(nonchalantly)</i>: Oh, no reason. It’s just fun – after a year of CFOs and stag dos – to take a nice old boy out on a spree.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><i>(In a car.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: All right, Arthur, nearly there.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Why do we <i>all</i> have to pick him up, anyway?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It’s just a little courtesy Mr. Birling likes, that’s all.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I’ve never <i>seen</i> you like this with a client, Douglas.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah, well, Mr. B is something special.
        <br><i>(Car pulls up.  Doors open.  Approaching footsteps.)</i>
        <br><b>Mr. BIRLING</b> <i>(posh voice)</i>: My dear boys! My dear boys! Cometh the hour, cometh the men; the magnificent men in their flying machines, no less.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Hello, Mr. Birling!
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Arthur, my dear boy! How are you? Now, I hope you’ve been brushing up on your rugby since we last met.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh yes! Ask me anything.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Who won the last Grand Slam?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(instantly)</i>: France!
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: What colour do Italy play in?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(instantly)</i>: Red.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: How many points for a conversion?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(instantly)</i>: Three.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Excellent; very good.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: How many did I get right?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Not a single one, but weren’t you quick?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I <i>was</i> quick!
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Like lightning, dear boy, absolute lightning. And a new face, I see.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Mr. Birling, may I introduce Martin Crieff.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Hello there, my little man. Now, ‘Crieff,’ ‘Crieff.’ Any relation to Jolyon Crieff?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I doubt it.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Ah, but one never knows, one never knows.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: One never does, but one can have a fairly strong hunch that no-one in one’s family has ever been called <i>Joly-on</i>.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Well, you’re quite right, of course. My chap was a Moncrieff – like Algernon.
        <br><i>(Silence.)</i>
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: In <i>Earnest</i>.
        <br><i>(More silence.)</i>
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: D’you know your Wilde, my boy?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I’m wild? In what sense?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: No, no, <i>Oscar</i> Wilde. Dear me, Douglas, you seem to have landed yourself a bit of a chump.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(spluttering)</i>: I beg your pardon?!
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Oh, granted, my little man, granted. No doubt you’re a valued alumnus of the University of Life ... or possibly Exeter.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What?!
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Douglas, old man, I take it congratulations are in order – final return to the captain’s seat of which you were such an ornament for so long.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No, no. Still in the ... co-pilot’s seat. But ... <i>(he forces a chuckle)</i> ... still terribly ornamental!
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Hmm. You don’t mean that ... that this young man’s the captain?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: <i>Yes</i>, that’s right. Does that concern you?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Oh, not in the least. I’m all for youth opportunities. I was just thinking what, er, an awful slap in the face it must be for Dougie here.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(faintly)</i>: Oh, no, not really.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Oh, but yes <i>yes</i> really. I mean, do you have to do everything he says?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well ...
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: And Arthur, my boy, are you still going around with that delightful girl with a squint?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Er, no.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Did she say she couldn’t see you any more?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah, she did.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Yes. I have to admit I prepared that one in advance. I was dreading that you might still be together so I couldn’t use it.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, we’re <i>not</i>.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Well, it wasn’t a <i>big</i> risk, I’ll admit. Just <i>look</i> at you.
        <br><i>(He claps his hands together.)</i>
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Right, that’s enough pleasantries, I think. Shall we go?
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><i>(The door to the portacabin opens.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... but now I’ve got a new way of remembering, because Ireland wear green, ’cause shamrocks are green; Scotland wear blue, ’cause it’s cold in Scotland; England wear red ’cause the flag’s <i>red</i>, white and blue.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: England wear white.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh yeah: England wear white ’cause the flag’s red, <i>white</i> and blue; France ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes, <i>jolly</i> good. Er, Martin, Mr. B’s all settled and I’ve got the weather for you.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Never mind the weather. What was all <i>that</i>?!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: All what?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: That astonishing display of synchronised sycophancy.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, <i>very</i> good. Have you been working on that for a while?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(sighing in exasperation)</i>: You said he was a nice old boy. He’s a <i>horrible</i> old boy.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: What, Mr. B? No!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It’s just his way, Martin – a little harmless joshing.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: He called <i>you</i> a failed criminal, and Arthur a repulsive half-wit.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: And <i>you</i> ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I know what he called me. Now how is that ‘harmless joshing’?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, I think for someone from his background, it’s ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(sighing)</i>: Oh, I see. <i>I</i> know what this is. It doesn’t matter how nasty he is, so long as he went to a jolly good public school, like you two.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh, now, that’s not fair at all! Arthur went to a <i>ghastly</i> public school.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: It’s true, I did. I mean, once, I was top in my year. <i>Me</i>!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well, for the duration of the trip, can we all please try to have a little professional dignity and not go all gooey just because a man in an embroidered waistcoat calls us ‘dear boys’?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: He didn’t call <i>you</i> a ‘dear boy’; he called you a ‘little man.’
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Martin, you don’t understand, though ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(interrupting)</i>: He understands perfectly, Arthur.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Hang on. <i>Hang</i> on. I know that tone of voice. What are you trying to stop Arthur from telling me?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I wouldn’t <i>dream</i> of trying ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Arthur?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, I was just gonna say: what about the tips?!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Ohhhh, I see.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Now, look ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: <i>Now</i> it begins to make sense. Big tipper, is he? How nice! So he can treat you how he likes, so long as he pays you off at the end of it. How <i>very</i> dignified.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It’s not <i>like</i> that ...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: How much does he give you, then? Go on.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It’s not ... it’s not a question of how mu...
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Come on!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, if you must know, last year he gave us five hundred pounds each.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: ... Oh. <i>Very</i> nice.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah, but that was unusual ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: True. That was because England won. We can’t expect that to happen <i>this</i> year.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Oh. Aren’t England good any more?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Not good enough to win a match between Wales and France, certainly.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><i>(In the flight deck.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: All right, let’s get ...
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(in a resigned voice)</i>: Oh, hello.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Carolyn! A flight deck visit. What a nice surprise.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Really? Is it really such a surprise to see me on Birling Day?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Perhaps not.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Perhaps indeed not. Open your flight bag.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: If you insist.
        <br><i>(Sound of Carolyn unzipping the bag and rummaging through it.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What’s going on?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: It’s a Birling Day tradition: a little contest Carolyn and I have, and that I win.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: It’s <i>not</i> a ‘tradition’ <i>or</i> a ‘contest’: it is systematic theft. You see, Martin, Mr. Birling is partial to twenty-five year old Talisker single malt whisky.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: As am I.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: As is Douglas – the difference being, of course, that Mr. Birling is a paying and valued customer, whilst Douglas is merely a sneaky thieving pilot.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: You drink his whisky on the trip?!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No, of <i>course</i> not! I <i>steal</i> his whisky on the trip, and drink it later.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Well, not this time. Philip! Arthur! Come in here!
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: You know Philip from the fire crew, don’t you?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Course. Good morning, Philip.
        <br><b>PHILIP</b>: Hallo, Mr. Richardson.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Good. Philip: frisk him, properly.
        <br><b>PHILIP</b> <i>(patting Douglas down)</i>: Sorry about this, Douglas.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Quite all right.
        <br><b>PHILIP</b>: Er, what am I looking for?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Tubes, reservoirs, bottles strapped to his legs; anything that can hold liquid. Now, let’s see what we have in your flight bag. Hip flask – an obvious decoy. Still ... <i>(She unscrews it.)</i> Ah. Water. Thought so. A shampoo bottle ... for coloured hair. Surely you’re not tinting, Douglas?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh! Does ‘coloured’ mean ‘dyed’? I thought it just meant ‘full of colour.’
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, of course you did(!) Well, that seems to be shampoo ...
        <br><i>(She unzips another pocket in the bag.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... and, what’s this? Nail varnish?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Nail varnish?!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Well, go on, sniff it. It <i>is</i> nail varnish.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes. Yes, it is. What do you want nail varnish for?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: If you <i>must</i> know, I find it prevents cracking and splitting.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: <i>Well</i>! I had <i>no</i> idea you were such a pretty pilot, Douglas!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(pointedly)</i>: <i>Anyway</i>, are you satisfied, Carolyn?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: For now, yes; but let me tell you this, Fingers: on your return, Philip here will be once more frisking you with digits dexterous with practice – and I shall be going through your flight bag with the very finest of tooth combs. And if any of these things have magically transformed from water, shampoo and ... nail varnish ...
        <br><i>(Martin giggles.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... into twenty-five year old Scotch, I shall know about it. Now then, Arthur.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yes, Mum!
        <br><i>(Clinking of small bottles.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: I have here thirteen little miniature bottles of Talisker. Guard them with your life. When it’s time to give Mr. Birling another whisky, you take one of these and a fresh glass, you open it in front of him, listening for the crack of the seal breaking, like so.
        <br><i>(‘Crack’ as she breaks the seal of one of the bottles.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And you pour it out for him with one hand.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Why only one hand?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Because with the other hand you will be most likely fighting off the Yogi Bear of the drinks trolley, First Officer Richardson. Here they are ...
        <br><i>(Clink of the bottles as she hands them over.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: ... Oh. Except you can’t give him this one. The seal’s been broken. Would, er, anybody like to try it? Oh! <i>(She chuckles.)</i> What am I thinking? You’re all about to go on duty. What a terrible shame(!) Oh, well, cheers.
        <br><i>(Pause as she takes a swig from the bottle.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Oh! That is <i>terribly</i> good.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><i>(Bing-bong.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(over cabin address system)</i>: Hallo, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to ... well, gentlemen ... well, gentle<i>man</i> ... well, Mr. Birling. Hallo, Mr. Birling!
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Hallo, Arthur.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(still over cabin address system)</i>: Ooh, hallo! Er, anyway, welcome aboard. Erm, the captain has now at this time disilluminated the seat belt sign ...
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Yes, I saw.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... er, right, so you can, if you wish, avail yourself of the opportunity to disengage your seatbelt at this moment in time.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Never did it up in the first place. I’m not a girl.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: ... Right. <i>(He laughs.)</i> Actually, I <i>like</i> doing it like this. It’s-it’s more like a chat, isn’t it?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: It <i>is</i> – the snag being, of course, that the last thing I want from you is a chat, whereas the <i>first</i> thing I want is another whisky.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ah. Right-o!
        <br><i>(He walks four paces to Mr. Birling’s side, ‘cracks’ open a bottle and pours it into a glass.)</i>
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Mmm! Yum-yum. Mmm.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Mr. B? What did you mean before when you said you weren’t surprised about Fliss and me breaking up?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Well, she was from a good family, wasn’t she?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: <i>I</i> liked them.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: There you <i>are</i>, then. Even if she <i>didn’t</i> get fed up with you – which frankly she surely did – doubtless her people put their foot down.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Why?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Well, for a start, you’re twenty-eight, you have a ridiculous job and you still live with your mother.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Well, yeah, but not in the, “Ooh, still lives with his mother” way people are thinking when they laugh about it. I ... I just live with her because we get on really well, like friends, so why pay rent?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: That is <i>precisely</i> what people are thinking when they laugh about it.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(plaintively)</i>: So ... you don’t think anyone will want to be with me?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Well, Arthur, what it really boils down to is: I’m bored of talking about this. Now, when do I get to visit the flight deck?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(sadly)</i>: I’ll-I’ll go and see.
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(into radio)</i>: Lundy, good afternoon. This is Golf Echo Romeo Tango India, maintaining flight level two-five-zero, direct Pole Hill.
        <br><b>LUNDY ATC</b>: Roger, Golf Tango India, maintain two-five-zero ...
        <br><i>(The flight deck door opens as ATC continues repeating back Martin’s message.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(morosely)</i>: Hello. Would you like your coffee yet?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Arthur? What’s the matter?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(sighing)</i>: Nothing. I just wondered if you wanted your coffee.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: And the thought reminded you of your cousin Vladimir who died in a coffee mine?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(sadly)</i>: No, I’m fine. I’ll go and get it. Oh, and Mr. Birling was wondering if he can come up to the flight deck yet.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Of <i>course</i>, of course! Send the old boy up.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What? No! of course <i>not</i>! What’s got into you both? You know the law!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(more brightly)</i>: Yeah, but it’s Mr. Birling! He <i>always</i> visits.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, I see. I wasn’t aware that the Air Navigation Order finished, quote, “... unless, of course, he went to the right school and is liable to tip you half a grand at the end of the flight,” unquote.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Ah, but that was only because England won.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Fine – a hundred quid. So much the more reason not to disregard ...
        <br><i>(Flight deck door opens.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What the ...?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Hello! I got bored waiting, so I thought what I’d do is just assume it would be fine.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Well... I-I-I’m sorry, sir, but it’s <i>not</i>. CAA regulations <i>and</i> the UK law forbid any non crew member on the flight deck during the flight.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Oh, nonsense. Sort this out, Douglas.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(apologetically)</i>: Erm, I’m very sorry, Mr. Birling. If the captain insists, there’s nothing I can do.
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: Oh dear. I was right. It <i>is</i> humiliating. You must feel <i>totally</i> emasculated. Ooh!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Sir, will you please return to your seat?
        <br><b>MR. BIRLING</b>: All right, all right. You mustn’t expect much of a tip from me, though, I’m afraid.

        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes(!) Maybe. Or maybe he’ll just get the tooth fairy to pop it under our pillows for him on her rounds.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: <i>I</i> know what will cheer us up. You <i>didn’t</i> manage to get any of that Talisker off the plane, did you, Douglas?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No, as it happens I didn’t.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: No, well ... I did.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Yeah. I mean, not lots or anything – just ... you remember that miniature you made me open, Douglas, that I couldn’t serve to Mr. Birling? Well, I’ve still got it!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, good work, Arthur! Well played!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Who wants a swig?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Er, yes please!
        <br><i>(He swallows a mouthful.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: That’s <i>horrible</i>!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: What?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(tetchily)</i>: Well, it <i>would</i> be. I stole all the Talisker while you were on the roof.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: But you-you <i>can’t</i> have done! They were all still sealed when I came down! I opened one at random!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No, they weren’t all still sealed. They all still made a *<i>khrrr</i>* noise. But you see, Arthur, there are <i>two</i> ways of making a whisky miniature make a *<i>khrrr</i>* noise. One certainly is to get an unopened one straight from the factory; but another is to take an open one and to dab the side of the cap with two spots of clear nail varnish. Yeah. So while Arthur was bravely searching for the TV aerial, I opened them all up and switched them for McHamish Tartan Terror – Mr. B being in no state to tell the difference – and then I hid the Talisker on the plane to reclaim at my leisure.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Oh, so at least we ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(interrupting)</i>: I hid it somewhere no-one would think to look for it or recognise it for what it was – somewhere <i>no-one</i> would touch it. I hid it in the ...
        <br><i>(Martin joins in with him.)</i>
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> and <b>DOUGLAS</b> <i>(simultaneously)</i>: ... McHamish Tartan bottle.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Yes. Mr. Birling <i>got</i> his Talisker after all. Let’s hope he appreciated it.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I don’t think he did.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No. I don’t think he did either.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: So we don’t have any good whisky ... or <i>bad</i> whisky ... <i>or</i> a tip.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: No.
        <br><i>(Pause.)</i>
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Anyone care for a shot of nail varnish?
